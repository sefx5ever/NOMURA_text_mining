TigerKingz,29,For Fun: Who is the secret Hedge Fund backing the GE short ?,"  

Just for Fun I wanted to put his post together (as a speculated guess) to uncover the Hedge fund backing the GE short.

It was recently disclosed that Harry Markopoulos has disclosed a potential accounting fraud in GE. He is backed by an undisclosed Hedge Fund.

I believe this hedge fund to be Pershing Square Capital Management (PSCM) Bill Ackmans fund because;

   
 

1. PSCM recently took a position in Berkshire Hathaway. (one of the biggest; best capitalised and most liquid insurers in America). GE is exact opposite, one of the worst capitalised insurers with little tolerance on the balance sheet for write downs, economic downturns and questions around the capital reserves.

The BRK position would act as the natural hedge to the GE short position.

If not GE what else is the hedge for his Berkshire trade??? PSCM is a hedge fund after all.

   
 

2. PSCM has been hit with reputational damage and regulator issues on the Herbal Life short in a past trade. 

Bill has mentioned in the media that he will be reluctant to approach a stock short in the same manner as Herbal Life due to reputational risk and also the risk that regulators are reluctant to investigate a company as the shorting Hedge Fund profits from the mere appearance of an investigation. 

To mitigate/avoid this risk, Bill has said instead PSCM will disclose in private to the regulator rather than make public disclosure. Markopoulos has said the regulator was informed before the August public disclosure.

   
 

3. Where is Bill Ackman? 

Normally Bill is in the media discussing/detailing the PSCM new positions. 

Also, in my opinion, Bill would likely oblige the media by publicly disclosing to the market that PSCM is not the Hedge fund shorting the GE stock, given point 2 above.

Bill's absence from the media is quite telling me.

Using Markopoulos to publicly disclose the trade is a shrewd/novel way of getting around this. 

   
 

4. Why would a Hedge Fund care if their publicly short a beaten up stock like GE?

Isn't the point of Hedge Funds to be long and short stocks and be market neutral - see point 2.

(I will defer that regulator issues may be one).

   
 

I did think the PSCM was the most likely from T+6hrs from the first disclosure so I may have had inbuilt bias. But we will see. This is just for fun with bit of logic and public knowledge, no more than Markopoulos has done for his research. 

(It really doesn’t matter who the Hedge Fund is)

   
 

Let’s hear your ideas or criticize my points."

ltdshred,19,Bridgewater hedge funds fall further on coronavirus market rout,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-bridgewater-idUSKBN21539W

(Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates LP, the Ray Dalio-led hedge fund giant famous for making money during the 2008 financial crisis, has posted double-digit losses so far this year amid sharp market declines sparked by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a note sent to clients on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. 

Through March 16, Bridgewater’s All Weather 12% volatility “risk parity” fund fell about 14% for the year; its Pure Alpha 18% volatility hedge fund declined about 21%; and its Major Markets 14% volatility hedge fund dropped about 7%, Dalio wrote. 
Dalio wrote that the performance was “not what I would want” but was “consistent with what I would have expected under the circumstances.” 
Bridgewater has assets under management of about $160 billion, according to its website, and is trusted by some of the world’s largest investors to safeguard their money no matter the economic environment. 
The S&P 500 index tumbled 7% on Wednesday, triggering a 15-minute trading halt of Wall Street’s main indexes for the second time this week, on fears that stimulus measures may not be enough to avert a coronavirus-driven recession. 

Dalio said Bridgewater’s portfolios were positioned for relative economic strength but also had hedges on in case of an unanticipated steep market decline. The firm’s risk controls worked as designed, he said, adding that Bridgewater remained liquid and able to adjust its positions. 
“Going forward, the world has now crossed a very dangerous threshold for financial markets and economies that poses great risks for all investors,” Dalio wrote, citing interest rates falling below zero percent amid an economic downturn, inequality and populism. 

“It is one we have been preparing for for a long time.” 

CHINA RUMORS 
On Wednesday, Dalio posted on popular Chinese microblogging site Weibo to dispel rumors about a Bridgewater blow-up. 

“There has been a rumor going around China that Bridgewater has ‘crashed’ or ‘is in trouble,’ Dalio wrote, attaching the client note with the firm’s performance and views. “You have my word that that is totally false and that Bridgewater is totally safe.” 
He condemned “bad people” who spread such rumors. “I think we might have identified the rumor monger which we will pursue legally and disclose publicly if we are able.”"

flatchampagne,0,Hedge fund Solus to close flagship investment vehicle - FT,"https://www.ft.com/content/da193096-63af-11ea-b3f3-fe4680ea68b5?shareType=nongift 

Article behind paywall so here you go:

Solus Alternative Asset Management, one of the best known specialists in distressed investments, is closing its flagship fund after suffering a combination of heavy redemptions and poor performance.

The hedge fund, which as recently as November managed $4.3bn in assets, is one of the first casualties of a collapse in the price of riskier assets this week. In a letter to investors in its Sola vehicle on Tuesday, the firm offered them the option to transfer their investments into new funds or face “an orderly liquidation” that would return their funds “as soon as practicable”.

“Due to the evolving state of the markets, this has left our flagship fund Sola with a high concentration of less liquid assets,” the letter said.


The Financial Times reported in December that Sola had suffered big losses after making a number of ill-fated bets on companies including satellite operator Intelsat and Pacific Gas and Electric. The fund finished the year down more than 8 per cent, after a 15 per cent drop in 2018. It had assets of about $4bn at the turn of the year.

Solus’s letter to investors said that “unexpected withdrawal requests” had followed reports of the firm’s difficulties in the financial press.

The company declined to comment.

Solus emerged as one of the most high-profile distressed investment firms in the US after its skirmish with Toys R Us employees in 2018 and a legal battle over derivatives with a Blackstone-owned hedge fund, GSO Capital Partners.

Now, though, it has become a victim of a string of corporate collapses that have tripped up US distressed investment funds, which look to profit from buying stocks and bonds of struggling companies at bargain prices.

Shares in Intelsat, a heavily indebted satellite group popular with hedge funds, collapsed as much as 75 per cent in November after a US regulator rejected its plans to raise money by selling off its airwaves. Some of the company’s bonds are now trading at about one-third of face value, as bondholders are braced for a potential wipeout.

Shares in two of Solus’s other equity investments, US coalminer Contura Energy and offshore drilling services group Hornbeck, both dropped about 90 per cent last year.

An investor report from January showed that 22 per cent of Sola’s exposure was to “energy equipment and services” companies: a sector that has been hit by a growing distaste among investors towards fossil fuels and, more recently, a sharp fall in the oil price.

Many other distressed specialists are smarting from bets on energy-related companies turning sour. Blackstone’s GSO faced ruptures in its distressed investment unit last year, for example, due in part to bad bets on ailing oil and gas groups, such as Oklahoma-based Tapstone Energy.

Investors who stick with Solus face two options.

They can switch over to what the firm calls a “long-term opportunities” fund that looks to invest in thinly traded assets. Alternatively, they can lock up their investments until 2021, by which time Solus will sell its illiquid holdings and reinvest the proceeds in more easily tradeable assets."

CautiousInvestor,13,Hedge-Fund Purge Deepens as $3 Trillion Market Retrenches.,"2019 marks the 5th straight year of negative net openings - i.e. more hedge-funds closed than opened. It's the 2nd worst year of this streak: net openings were -149, vs -328 in the worst year, 2016. Overall, more than hedge-funds 4,000 died during this streak.

The S&P 500 performed exceptionally well, delivering a 28% gain this year through November, while hedge-fund returns were poor, with the Bloomberg Equity Hedge Fund Index at only 10%. These are poor returns in an absolute sense, not just compared to S&P performance. In other words, even if S&P performance was average, these would be poor returns considering the high management fees charged by hedge-funds. January through November 2019 saw a total flow of $81.5 out of hedge-funds.

The article contains a list of notable hedge-funds that shut down this year. You'll notice some pretty well-known names in that list, including a Citadel fund:

researchmind,3,Hedge funds control 35-45% of Osram shares in headache for suitor AMS: source," 

MUNICH (Reuters) - Hedge funds control 35-45% of the shares of German lighting group Osram ([OSRn.DE](https://www.reuters.com/companies/OSRn.DE)), posing a headache for Austrian suitor AMS ([AMS.VI](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMS.VI)) as the investors may press for the $5 billion offer to be sweetened, a person close to the matter said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of German lighting manufacturer Osram is illuminated at the company's headquarters in Munich, Germany, September 16, 2019. REUTERS/Andreas Gebert/File Photo

An initial bid by AMS to create a global leader in sensors and lights stumbled last month when it fell short of the necessary shareholder backing. Since then AMS has lowered the acceptance threshold to 55% to try to get the deal over the line, while keeping the offer price at 41 euros a share.

Osram Chief Executive Olaf Berlien told German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung that some investors seem to have no intention of tendering their shares by the Dec. 5 deadline.

“It appears that a number of hedge funds have acquired shares with the aim of selling them at a later date and at a higher price,” he told the newspaper, which first reported the stakes held by hedge funds.

German law allows for courts to determine that minority investors be compensated at a higher price for their shares when an acquirer and a target company strike a so-called domination agreement, which regularly prompts hedge funds to hold back shares aiming to benefit from a deferred sale.

However, if too many speculative investors decide to hold back shares that can lead to deals falling apart, as seen in initial failed attempts for a leveraged buyout of generics firm Stada. That deal eventually went through in 2017 after the offer price was bumped up.

AMS - which already controls 20% of Osram - said on Wednesday that 3.3% of Osram shares have been tendered so far.

On Oct 31, hedge fund Sand Grove Capital Management disclosed a 5.75% Osram stake.

Around 10% of Osram shares are held by exchange-traded funds, which according to German law, are not allowed to sell their stake as long as the takeover is not completed, banking sources have said.

Retail investors, which often ignore tender offers, hold 20%-25%, the sources have said."

And lets say that I want to hook up friends so they can come along for the ride.  My initial investment would be 100k for myself, and since I’m such a great guy I would give 10k to 10 friends so they could invest that in my fund.  So the fund would start with 200k with 20 shares and I’d be in charge of all investment decisions.  I would also want to keep the expenses as low as possible so no 2-20 type of fees, but something like \*actual\* fees per share .

Is there a name for such a model?  It’s close to a hedge fund, but hedge fund participants usually have to be filthy rich and ”sophisticated“.  My members wouldn’t be anything of the sort.  They can put in 10k and not a cent more.  They can withdraw anytime they want, but if they do, they divest the entirety of their single share.

Ten years ago this month, the world’s financial system nearly ground to a halt. It was a dramatic and pivotal time, which has had lasting effects on many people’s lives. But it was also something that has happened many times in history and will happen many times in the future. As you know, I believe that everything happens over and over again and that by looking at those things happening many times, one can see the patterns and understand the cause-effect relationships to develop principles for dealing with them. Prior to 2008, I had studied these relationships for debt crises with my colleagues at Bridgewater, and because we understood these relationships, we were able to navigate the crisis well when many others struggled. 

Today I am sharing our understanding of how debt crises work and how to navigate them well in a new book called “A Template for Understanding Big Debt Crises.” I am making it available for free because I am now at a stage of life where what’s most important to me is to pass along the principles that have helped me. My hope is that sharing this template will reduce the chances of big debt crises happening and help them be better managed in the future.

> Lampert’s ESL Investments wants Hoffman Estates-based Sears Holdings Corp. to restructure more than $1 billion in debt and sell about $1.5 billion in real estate and about $1.75 billion other assets, including the company’s popular Kenmore appliance brand, according to a proposal made public in a regulatory filing Monday.

> ESL offered to buy Kenmore and certain other divisions of the retailer’s business in April. But the latest proposal is broader and pushes the company to act more quickly in the face of “significant near-term liquidity constraints,” including a $134 million debt payment due next month.

> Sears said it had received ESL’s proposal and directed the company’s management and advisers to work with the hedge fund. A board committee already negotiating with ESL on the proposal to buy Kenmore will review the proposed real estate deal, Sears said.

...

> He wrote that he still thinks Sears can get back to profitability as a smaller company

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/24/business/sears-bankruptcy-lampert-deal.html

> The latest rescue attempt is also complicated because ESL is controlled by Mr. Lampert, who has an unusual role at Sears. He is chief executive and chairman of the retailer. And in addition to being the largest shareholder, his hedge fund holds roughly 40 percent of Sears’s debt, giving him claim on a great deal of the company’s assets, particularly its real estate.

I'm highly confident Sear's management at this point would rubber stamp anything that the CEO or his hedge fund would do, as any competent managers would've left already or are playing along with the CEO's games for their own gain."

eeg_bert,1,Modeling the World Class Return Profiles of Venture Capital vs. PE vs. Hedge Funds,"I'm trying to model the approximate return profiles of *world class* venture capital/PE/hedge funds (i.e., top 1% funds). The model includes three pieces: (i) probability; (ii) return multiple; (iii) scale at which investing can be done. (There's already lots of information online about IRRs; I'm trying to look at these categories from the probabilistic perspective of individual bets).  Do my assumptions look reasonable?

**Venture Capital/Angel.** A *world class* early stage investor can achieve the following return profile up until about a $1M check size. These investors tend to write many checks; most investments essentially go to zero, but a few return an enormous return to make up the difference.

| **Probability** | **Return Multiple** |

| 10%         | 0x              |

up to $500M scale.

**Opportunistic hedge funds.** Hedge funds looking for assymetric bets at scale might be modeled as

| **Probability** | **Return Multiple** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 15%         | 15x             |

| 10%         | 0x              |

and they can do this reliably up to $10B of scale.

AHoomanBeanz,11,Adam Rodman's -- founder/CIO of Segra Capital Management (Dallas-based Hedge Fund) -- arguments for an emerging uranium supercycle,"Text is from an interview transcript he did with RealVision...

&#x200B;

The way that I would boil down everything that's happened over the last 18 months-- supply cuts, growing demand out of emerging markets, every catalyst that we've listed-- is shifting the power to that of the uranium mining industry globally. They now wield more power enforcing that bid offer spread in the market to be crossed, because they have now shown that they're willing to shut in production, by spot to converge to two prices, leaving utilities in a bad position to source their material when the contracting cycle starts without it being at much, much higher prices.  

My name is Adam Rodman. I am the founder and CIO of Segra Capital Management, a Dallas based hedge fund. We've been particularly focused on the nuclear power and uranium space over the last several years. And Real Visions invited me back here today to talk about it for, I think, the third installment of Segra's views on the topic. 

**What's the function and demand for uranium?**

For those of you who missed the first two installments, what we've been very focused on is the commodity, uranium, the mined substance commonly known as yellowcake or U308.  

It's a very niche and kind of small commodity in the scheme of things, but powers or is the critical fuel for what is arguably the most important power source globally, which is nuclear power. And so in the most simplest terms, uranium, U308, yellowcake is a mined powdery substance that global producers pull out of the ground in far flung places such as Kazakhstan, but also in the US, Canada, and Australia. It's then enriched and converted into fuel that can be used by the globe's reactors. And that would be nuclear power plants.  

**Can you explain the current state of the market?**

So one of the big questions that were asked often is around our call from I think the episode we did for Real Vision in November, December 2017, that some of the world's biggest and best minds were going to have to come offline, essentially, as some of their contracted material was going to come up for recontracting, given how low prices were. So generally speaking, a miner, a producer of uranium will sell forward into long term contracts and lock in a price. And while we've now been in this multi-year bear market, many producers stayed solvent and profitable because of those past contracts.  

But as time moves on and the cycle progresses, and eventually, these producers have to restructure their contracts, market prices tend to prevail. And what we tried to hammer home back a little more than a year ago now in our first installment was that no miner was rationally going to sell their pounds at a loss in a new contract. 

And so we were good or we were lucky in predicting that Cameco in particular was going to be forced to permanently shut down MacArthur River. At the end of 2017 they announced a temporary shutdown, and then a permanent one just this past summer in 2018, which removed a significant portion, 15% to 18% of world supply from the market kind of in one fell swoop, which is a very, very big deal. 

But really, the economics behind that decision to a certain extent still apply today. So what I urge everybody to keep looking at is really, what the global marginal cost curve is in the world, which is where people can profitably mine the next marginal pound of uranium versus prices in the market today. And really, when I was last on, or in the first full installment a little more than a year ago-- I forget exactly-- but uranium prices were either in the high teens or low 20s. We've moved now closer to $30, which is a very good return on a percentage basis. And I believe it makes uranium the best performing hard commodity for 2018, which was a brutal year for resources.

But reminding everybody that we have a long way to go. Because even if spot prices are $28 to $30, marginal costs are likely twice that going forward. And given that we see pretty significant deficits over the coming five or 10 years, marginal cost becomes all important, and it's much, much higher than it is here. 

**How is uranium traded?**

The uranium market is unique not only kind of in how off the radar it is, but also, in the way that it's traded. So there are really two important prices. One you can pull up on your Bloomberg. And unfortunately, it's the less relevant one which leads to a lot of the opportunity in the market, the inefficiency in the market. And the second is the contract market, which is essentially a bespoke bilateral agreement between XYZ utility and a producer of uranium. And those numbers get aggregated by third party sources, but they are not public and transparent in the way that spot prices are. 

You can pull up spot prices on a Bloomberg terminal. It's technically quoted in spot and the futures market. But again, it's pretty thinly traded, and this is somewhat of an indicative price. It has been important for sentiment for reasons that I think we can maybe get into when we talk about supply and demand a little bit further.  

But it's not exactly relevant to the market, because when again, let's take a utility, let's just say, Duke Energy goes out to supply their long term fuel requirements. They don't source the bulk of that material in the spot market. They don't go in and buy every day. They will go to one of the producers of uranium and essentially strike a term contract whereby they receive a predetermined amount of material at a predetermined price delivered to them in all the years that the contract specifies. 

The market today has had very, very little-- in fact, 2018 had just about no contract volume going through-- despite a rising spot price. And to take it back to the two different prices, it's important because spot prices maybe are a little bit of a sentiment indicator. As people look to see whether or not things are going up or down, spot might be a daily price that you can look at. But the economics of any mine or miner is going to be driven by where they're ultimately able to contract their uranium long term.  

We believe those prices today are effectively at the marginal cost, at a minimum. Meaning that prices of uranium today are really $45 to $65 depending on jurisdiction, et cetera, even though the spot price only shows $30. But I think what the market is waiting for-- and again, why the opportunity continues to improve, get better and better even after the MacArthur mines shut down, spot prices rallied, is that the market is waiting to see for contracting start. And people, investors, especially after an eight year bear market, are skeptical that prices will actually be at an economic price.  

And I guess what we believe strongly and what I'd be urging viewers is to be looking for in whatever news source or other third party source you can work contracts eventually get struck, because we believe it has to be at an economic price. That economic price is almost 100% higher than the current spot price. And that that is the critical data point for the market to really take off. Because again, the spot prices, while they might be a feel good price, a sentiment indicator, a directional indicator, they're not driving the business model necessarily of any mining company out there that mines uranium.

**What's the catalyst for prices to move higher?**

Production cuts and spot buying has led to a very strong move in the underlying commodity in 2018. But important catalysts to look for the space as a whole really revolves around contracting. Getting back to the basic dynamics of the uranium market, it's a pretty simple market. You have really, one buyer, and that's global utilities. And you have a relatively small group of mines that produce and then sell to those utilities.  

But unlike other commodities, and I think I mentioned this in some of the other interviews or segments that I did for Real Vision, demand is completely inelastic. It doesn't really come in when prices are low. It doesn't really stop when prices are high. It just really comes in around the cycle.  

But when utilities find that they have uncovered requirements going forward, usually, for the next five or 10 years, they re-enter the market. Again, buying not because prices are low or high, but buying purely on need. And that's because the actual uranium price, the U308 price, is a very, very small percentage of the cost of operating a reactor.  

Going forward, what are the all important catalysts for the uranium market as a whole really are uranium buying, the beginning of the contracting cycle, and then where they are going to be able to find those pounds of uranium that they need for their requirements into the future. They being the existing nuclear reactors, but also, the very large quantity of new reactors, which are being built and delivered over the next several years in the emerging markets.  

And given that we are forecasting a deficit, and a deficit that doesn't have a good chance of being met because of the lack of Capex invested in the space over the last eight years, we think that they might have a lot of trouble doing so. Meaning that prices can really accelerate to the upside, again, once the contracting cycle begins.  

The other element this thesis is that there are a lot of natural catalysts that have to occur in this market in the case that we're wrong in our views. And what do I mean by wrong in our views? Let's just say that contracting is delayed, utilities don't come in to buy, meaning that there is no contract price that goes through at $50 or $60, that then justifies further mine development, and new supply coming into the market.

Well, the economics of the existing mine base isn't getting any better. In fact, costs are rising. So it's an environment where we have a rising cost curve. The price dynamics that forced Cameco to shut down MacArthur River, won't be changing in that circumstance. So again, in this low price environment, only more supply is going to be forced to come off as less legacy contracts exist. So producers are going to be forced to strike new contracts at prevailing market prices, which is below their cost of mining and as they face the natural depletion of their resources.  

However, as we saw in 2018, and as will continue in 2019 and 2020, if prices don't rise to restart mines, the likes of Cameco and other producers will follow, will buy in the spot market, which is cheaper than producing. Creating kind of a natural floor in the market.  

So while that's not a catalyst per se, we still look at it as a driver of prices short term. Because the spot market again, is thin. It's not exactly relevant to utilities, but it is important for setting a base in terms of the way that market dynamics are established. And that base should, in our opinion, continue to rise in a noncontracting environment, acting almost as its own catalyst, at the very least, as a margin of safety. Because you have a bid, a persistent bid in the market to be buying material, even if the contracting cycle doesn't start. And then that seems to be lost on all on a lot of market participants.  

What is lost on a lot of investors is that if prices stay, let's just say, where they are now, producers will continue to shut in supply. Take the pounds that would otherwise be coming out of mines, and replace that with spot market purchases. Which will at very least underpin that price at these levels, if not drive it higher, until that contracting cycle starts. So call that a catalyst, if you want, a natural catalyst. Or at the very least, you know, call it a margin of safety. But either way, it's a very strong dynamic which gives, I think, investors protection here, even in the downside. While we wait for the extreme portions of the thesis to come over the next one, two, three plus years.

**Why haven't equities moved up as fast as the commodity?**

So one question that we get asked often, given that we've been kind of vocal proponents of this idea over the last year, year and a half, is why we haven't seen kind of a lockstep move in the equity space with the price of spot. Again, spot rising from the high teens towards $30, that's a significant return. No equity in the space has matched that I can think of, the return of the underlying commodity. And so why is that?  

Well, before we get into it, let's talk about the market structure. The uranium and nuclear power related sector has been decimated in the post-Fukushima world. Talking about uranium specifically, the market capitalization was around $130 billion pre-Fukushima. There were 450 plus companies in the space. And today, we have 40 companies, and a market cap even when including giants like Cameco Corp, and now, Kazatomprom that is under $10 billion. And before Kazatomprom's IPO in 2018, it was around $7 billion. 

It's been really decimated, and there aren't a lot of options. In terms of the companies that are left-- really, most of the companies are miners. But they get broken down into those that are currently in production. So they have an active mine. Those that are developing mines or restarting mines if the price gets to a level that's economically viable. And then there are really, exploration companies. So companies that are going out and trying to build a resource base to eventually build a mine.  

So when we take that, let's say, opportunity set in the context of the uranium price, maybe we can understand why the equity space hasn't really followed suit. Undoubtedly, the producers, those that are currently producing, have seen the best performance within the space. And that's probably obvious, because your average investor looks at what they're going to end up selling the price for. In the market or in a contract that's rising, it's better for their business model.  

But development companies and exploration companies have been laggards. And they've really traded more defensively than the resource sector, which had a very, very bad 2018. But they have not been moving in lockstep. And that's because the critical component to them having a viable business model is a contract price that enables them essentially, to fund their mine development or exploration, and then produce economically in the future.  

And we think there is a huge opportunity in this, generally speaking, because we forecast supplydemand, which we believe goes into a significant deficit. And then we layer over a price that we believe the world needs to see those various pounds at different time intervals and a different demand levels to essentially bring that production online. And what that makes us highly confident in is that the contract price, and the forward price, however you want to think about it, today is above $55 or so globally for the next marginal pound.  

And if and when that happens, you know, contract cycles are inevitable. Utilities exist in the world. It's actually a growth industry. Demand for nuclear is growing. And they will eventually contract. In fact, the upcoming years are heavy contracting years.  

**What do you say to skeptics of the thesis?**

Yes. So people who are skeptical of the market would maybe point to the lack of equity follow through for most of the sector as showing that it's wrong, or that prices aren't going to rise and. I just choose to take the other side of that. Again, contract prices are what's relevant. We didn't see contract pricing in 2018. Part of that is due to the section 232 petition filed by US miners, essentially asking the government to put a quota system in on US uranium, forcing US utilities to buy a certain quota of material from US producers. Until a judgment is finalized on that, US utilities have been absent from the contracting market, and global utilities have followed the US block in waiting to see the resolution before contracting.  

But that doesn't mean that the price isn't going to be higher. In fact it gives, I think, investors a very small window of opportunity in a highly inefficient market to front run the inevitable, which is contract prices that reflect the economic price of mining. Which again, is much higher than the market is being given credit for.

**What is section 232?**

 In the last section, I mentioned section 232. Let me just quickly and simply kind of summarize what that is and why it matters. Many viewers might remember the petition to the Trump administration to kind of protect the US steel industry from foreign dumping of steel. And the avenue by which they asked the Trump administration to protect that domestic industry was called a section 232 petition.  

It goes to the Commerce Department. It essentially presents why action needs to be taken to protect a certain domestic industry. The uranium mining industry in the US took a lead from steel companies, and decided that because the likes of Kazakhstan, potentially Russia, had been selling cheap, cheap material into the market, pushing down prices, and thereby, endangering their business models, that they too, should get a form of protection from the Commerce Department so that they could be viable.  

The reason it becomes extremely relevant here again, probably more so than for other commodity markets, is that it put US utilities and global utilities in a holding pattern for striking new term contracts. And that is the only demand in this market. There is almost no financial speculation, at least not yet, in the uranium market where the likes of you or I would go in and take very, very large uranium positions expecting a resolution, and expecting utilities to come in.  

It happens a little bit here and there, and there were some financial volume speculator volume going through in 2018. But it's not like oil, or copper, or really, any other commodity in that sense. So it's all important that utilities enter. But while they wait to find out how the US government is going to rule on where they are allowed to source their uranium fuel, everything has been put on hold so.  

And I think the most important thing to understand about the way that utilities interact with producers, and therefore, why 232 ends up being important, is that the price of uranium. And by that, I mean the price at which a utility can source contracts for uranium has been, in our opinion, at $45 or $50 or $55 for the last several years. But no transactions have taken place.  

A year ago, spot prices were at $20. And a fuel buyer would go to their manager and say, listen, we don't have uranium for delivery in 2022, '23, '24, and '25. We're a little low. We should go buy some. And the fuel manager would say, great, go out there, and try and source material. Fuel buyer goes to XYZ uranium production company, says, hey, we're looking for a four year contract, where are you guys going to sell this material? And they say $50.  

Fuel buyer goes back to fuel manager and says, $50 is the price. And the fuel manager pulls up his Bloomberg terminal and sees spot prices at $20, and says, there's no way I'm paying more than 100% premium to what I see on the screen. The market's been oversupplied for many, many, many years. There's no reason for me to move.

And the way that I would boil down everything that's happened over the last 18 months-- supply cuts, growing demand out of emerging markets, every catalyst that we've listed for you not only in this segment, but the ones before-- is shifting the power to that of the uranium mining industry globally.  

That's to say that they now wield more power enforcing that bid offer spread in the market to be crossed. Because they've now shown that they're willing to shut in production, by spot to converge to two prices, et cetera leaving utilities in a bad position to source their material when the contracting cycle starts without being at much, much higher prices.  

And 232, just to tie it all together, just forced the market to wait a little bit longer, because those contracts weren't going to happen or aren't going to happen until we get a resolution.

**Why do you have such high conviction in this trade?**

We as a firm have obviously dedicated a lot of time to this topic. And the question I think for many, is maybe, why, or why is this cycle so different. In the context of a commodity cycle that has inelastic demand, deficits are all important. And not a lot of people that are around in the investment community today were here investing the last time the uranium market went into a deficit, which was many decades ago.  

Even when we've seen epic price runs to the tune of multiple hundreds of percent in a few quarters time, it was done in a balance to surplus market. Which leads us to wonder you know exactly what is going to happen in the uranium market if we do stay in sustained deficit. And to be clear, by our numbers, and I believe we've done as much work as anybody, if not more on the topic, we're in deficit now, and we will be in sustained deficit for the next several years going forward.  

And the longer it takes for the price to rise, the more severe the deficit is going to be in the future. Meaning that positioning today kind of becomes all important, because when these cycles move, they move quickly. And again, if a contract gets struck tomorrow, we believe wholeheartedly that it's going to happen at a price that is maybe 50%, 75%, 100% higher at a minimum, to spot prices, and the entire sector will likely rerate.  

The mega bull case comes if and when the market realizes that at any price, there is not enough material that can be produced from global mines and secondary supplies to fill the growing demand from the existing and growing nuclear fleet globally. And that's kind of the big picture."

Swatieson,459,"As ETFs blow past hedge funds, Paul Singer has had enough, says they are ‘devouring capitalism’","Wall Street is increasingly worried about a world dominated by index funds and ETFs.

Elliott's Paul Singer, one of the most respected hedge fund managers out there, said the decline of active management is hurting the free market.

""Passive investing is in danger of devouring capitalism,"" the hedge fund manager wrote in a July investor letter, the contents of which were confirmed by CNBC. ""In a passive investing world, small shareholders have little-to-no voice and no realistic possibility of banding together, while the biggest shareholders have no (repeat, no) skin in the game so long as the money manager does not underperform the index.""

Elliott Management has $32.8 billion of assets under management as of May 2017, according to Reuters. Singer founded the firm in 1977. The manager's investor letter remarks were first reported by Bloomberg News.

His comments come as a ETFGI.com report last week showed that assets in the global exchange-traded funds industry alone (not including index funds) amounted to $4.17 trillion a the end of the second quarter, a trillion dollars more than the hedge fund industry Singer calls home.

""What may have been a clever idea in its infancy has grown into a blob which is destructive to the growth-creating and consensus-building prospects of free market capitalism,"" Singer wrote.

He's not the only one on Wall Street sounding the alarm. Hans Redeker, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Morgan Stanley, told CNBC in July he is concerned over the decline of active fund management.

""I do not like what I see, because you have to consider when you have people getting more involved with passive investment strategies, the market will be less able to react to minor distortions or minor declines on the fundamentals side,"" Redeker said.

""From an aggregate point of view it is frightening. It means that at one point you will not have the active end in the market to stabilize it. You would have just the passive guys getting into herd mentality,"" he added.

Approximately $2.2 trillion of assets are indexed to the S&P 500, according to the S&P Dow Jones Indices' website. In 2016, passive funds attracted a net $508.4 billion while active suffered $340.1 billion in outflows, according to Morningstar. That trend has continued this year.

Elliott is still sticking to the active management game though. In fact, the firm on Friday revealed a 4.9 percent equity stake and 1.1 percent of additional long exposure through derivatives in NXP Semiconductors. It said in a filing the company's shares are ""significantly undervalued.""

Elliott Management did not respond to a request for comment.

* Futures surged after third-biggest weekly U.S. pork purchase

* African swine fever, which is highly lethal and difficult to contain, was first reported in China last August. It’s taken time for the disaster to play out, but it’s arrived. Pork prices in the Asian nation have shot up, and the Chinese government said its sow breeding herd was down about 15 percent. That decline is bigger than the entire herd of North America.

* Futures have skyrocketed, with the most-active June contract up 26 percent in March to the highest since it started trading in late 2017.

* Helping fuel the rally is the notion that hog casualties in China are probably bigger than what’s been officially reported by the government. Vietnam reported its first cases in February, and has already reported nearly double the number of Chinese cases. China has many times the animals, and the disease has been spreading for months throughout the nation.

* A hole in Chinese production of say 20 percent means there won’t be enough pork in the world and prices will have to “increase significantly” in order to ration out supplies, said Altin Kalo, an analyst at Manchester, New Hampshire-based Steiner Consulting Group."

Of course the problem with looking at average performance is that everyone is convinced they can find (or can be) the above average manager, just like most people think they're above average drivers, or will have above average kids, or an uncommonly happy marriage. We're all the stars of our own stories, and of course some people really are above average, at least for a time."
Dont_Prompt_Me_Bro,671,Warren Buffet's million dollar bet ends this year: hedge funds vs index funds,"In 2007, Buffet made a [one million dollar bet](http://longbets.org/362) with Ted Seides of Protege Partners that over a period of 10 years, a low cost S&P 500 index fund would deliver a better return to investors than any five hedge funds hand picked by Ted.

The bet matures this year and [the results show](http://imgur.com/4QguHTe) that Buffet is set to win by quite a margin.

The results indicate that in seven of the nine years, the Vanguard S&P 500 has beaten the average of all 5 hedge funds selected. The overall gain to date shows that the index fund is at least 20% clear of it's nearest competitor.

Buffets reasoning is quite clear:

If ""passive investors"" invest in index funds that track the average movement of the market- they must by definition do average. If this is true than the ""active investors"" (those that try to maximise their returns by investing more strategically and with less diversity) must as a whole, also be doing averagely.

The key difference between these two groups is that the active investors are paying significantly higher fees to their fund managers. It's these fees that give the index fund the edge. Buffet has continued to advocate for low cost index funds in his [latest Berkshire Hathaway letter](http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2016ltr.pdf).

What does r/investing think about the whole thing? Buffet isn't claiming that it's impossible to beat the market. But he mentions in his letter that it's a lot more difficult to pick the right investment managers then you think.

This quote stuck out to me: 
>“There are, of course, some skilled individuals who are highly likely to out-perform the S&P over long stretches. In my lifetime, though, I’ve identified – early on – only ten or so professionals that I expected would accomplish this feat.”

If one of the greatest and well connected investors in history claims to only know ten or so professionals who could reliably outperform the market, what hope do the rest of us have?

> Undisclosed Position #1: This quarter, our partners will notice a new investment in their portfolios (it’s our first new investment in over a year). We are still building the position, so I’ll refrain from publicly speaking about the opportunity in detail8.

>However, I’ll note that this is a recent IPO, and is one of the earliest points in a company’s lifecycle that I’ve ever invested at before. The firm has been operating for over 8 years, still unprofitable, and faces intense competition from well-funded rivals (it’s currently neck-to-neck for the #1 spot).

>While all of our research indicates that it has every “right to win”, with a clear path to monetization, it hasn’t proven this out yet. Investors tend to be the “show me” type and are waiting to give it credit. But within five years, I think it will be in a drastically different competitive position and investors will view it with a very different lens. We chose to participate earlier in the company lifecycle, because the risk-reward of the situation was too good to pass up.

>In terms of valuation, it’s trading at a very large (even irrationally large, in our view) discount to its most comparable peer – even after accounting for the differences in business model, industry competition, ARPU per user, etc. In terms of relative valuation, this peer trades at 3x the multiple (or a “30-cent dollar”). This is particularly surprising, seeing as our company is growing 20%  faster than its peer (we expect 40% CAGRs), in a more nascent market, and only in the beginning innings of monetizing its user base. Given this, we have a pretty clear idea of what “winning” would do for the stock’s valuation.

> The [potential amount (i.e. margins)] x [runway (i.e. duration of cash flows)] for profitable growth is magnitudes larger, but the market is missing it since most investors are overly focused on the next few years of short-term competition and losses9. In terms of re-investment returns, I estimate the company is earning as high as 500% returns on its most profitable projects. Additionally, I expect the distribution of returns between low-performing and high-performing investments to narrow over time, as the company collects more data on its users and their habits. This enables them to invest / bid more accurately for projects, which provides greater selection and customer value, and in turn provides more data to hone the project selection process – thus completing a “data-driven” flywheel effect.

> Shares dropped as low as -15% from its IPO price, and we were buying on this opportunity. But given its early stage, don’t expect this company to become one of our top positions anytime soon. Instead, I view it like investing in a Series B venture round – it has a real business model, proven financials, users who value the service, and a roadmap to profitability. But it hasn’t necessarily “won” yet10. Similar to venture investing, I plan to size the position small for now, and “double-down” as the company continues to hit our KPIs and prove that the thesis is on track11.

> Once I’m comfortable with the position size, I’ll discuss the investment in more depth, in subsequent letters and/or write-ups.

So this stock is either poorly covered or misunderstood. My theory is that it's the former, and possibly not listed in the US.

MasterEpictetus,1,"On the performance of Hedge funds, Mutual funds, and Index funds","Please, help me understand this.

In learning about investing, I realize that managed mutual funds consistently under-perform the  market in the long run due to their high cost (fees, turnover, taxes, etc.), they are riskier than index funds (according to data shown by Bogle), and their performance gets worse as they grow. As far as I can see, there is no good reason to invest in managed funds unless you're ignorant about investing (and to be fair, most people are).

I thought things would be different for Hedge funds. They have fewer restrictions, more freedom in their strategies, they can take short positions, they use the most advanced computer technology and they have the smartest quants. Besides, they manage the money of very wealthy (and possibly higher-educated) people and institutions. And they do charge handsomely for their services too.

Therefore, hedge funds must consistently outperform the market, right? Well, the evidence seems to point out that no. Not even close. And the promise of providing consistent returns on good and bad markets doesn't seem to be hold either.

If this is true, then why are these wealthy people and institutions pouring money into hedge funds? I just don't get it. And are index funds the only sane way to invest? And why do people in this sub talk about picking stocks with the hopes of beating the market when even the most experienced and intelligent investors in the world with the most resources and more freedom can't?

""**Hedge funds are in a 'vicious downward cycle'**"" means cash investors' / savers' investment is not compounding. The hedge fund owners themselves are quarterly or by other cycle continuing to make money, even with under-performance via some of the highest management fees in the fund / asset management sector.

As hedge funds are meant to be unique 'edgy' investment vehicles e.g.overweight and concentrated in a stock etc. The fact that collective data about hedge funds **"" favorite stocks"" suggests they are the same as mutual funds, i.e. stock-pickers**. The differentiation is minimal in performance and other aspects; apart from the reward-structure to hedge-fund owners and other legal aspects such as off-shore registration.

adahylgarcez,1,Marketing - Hedge Fund Industry,"For the context, I'm an intern in an asset management firm in Brazil and have no marketing background.

I'm trying to build a case about the communication in this industry, in Brazil and around the world. How is it changing? What are the trends? What are the other firms doing ? What can we do?

&#x200B;

The way of reaching investors didn't change much in the past few years, very few firms venture in social media, even though we generate quite a bit of content, they are sent by email in the forms of reports to the clients. 

The relationship is mostly with the big clients, face to face, by calling, talking over lunch/dinner etc.

The problem is, this worked back then when each firm had a few big clients. Now, those big clients represents each time a smaller and smaller part of our asset under management.

In Brazil people are investing each time more through apps, so we don't have even the clients contacts anymore, they are just numbers, we receive an email (client 432353 deposited 2k) and that's it. Those clients are A LOT more sensible to volatility and we can't reach them by the old ways to put them at ease to avoid the withdraws in bad times because first there is too many of them, second even if we had the staff, we don't have their contact, the app has it.

This remembers me the biography of Steve Jobs when it tells about when newspapers started selling through the Apple Store and Apple wouldn't give them the contact of their clients so the newspapers couldn't reach them anymore.

&#x200B;

Even though I don't have a background in marketing, I wanted to take a look into that and build a case to present the partners.

&#x200B;

I know it's a really open question but if anyone could point me a direction, book recommendations, academic thesis, anything that might help, it would be much welcomed. (Btw I started reading Marketing 4.0 from Kotler)

Imagine being a wealth manager out of Geneva in 1912, trying to create a nice diversified portfolio of developed market bonds, and emerging market bonds, says Sokoloff.


Say 39% of client assets would be split between stocks of Great Britain, France, German Empire, Austria-Hungary and Italy: truly mature, developed markets.


Some 21% of assets would go into stocks of the two fastest growing economies: Russian Empire and North American United States. The wealth manager might also put a smidge into emerging economies like Argentina, Brazil or Japan.


In bonds, allocation would be somewhat similar. Gilts with sub-3% yield would be the benchmark, with the rest of developed and emerging bonds trading at a spread.


Alternatives investment could be in anything ranging from arable land in central Russia or the Great Plains, to shares of new automotive or aeroplane startups in Europe and America, to Japanese manufacturing ventures.


This well-intentioned, balanced portfolio would be in for a wild ride in the next decade and possibly drawdowns of as much as 80%. The saving grace would have been to invest in Detroit startups or other investments that successfully straddled wars, Russian revolution, crises and the technological boom of the early 20th century.


Most investment strategies follow a Taleb distribution, whereby an appearance of low risk and steady returns camouflages a reality, which is a high probability of a small gain, but a small probability of a very large loss that more than outweighs the gains.

You could be making 5% per year but then there could come a year that you lose 30% or maybe more, and that's kind of the big nature of the Taleb distribution


liquidity events are so insidious that your benefits are gone simply because your correlations start converging to one.

- As some fund managers had more than 1 stock, I divided the $10,000 equally over the two or three stocks.
- As not all stocks are denominated in USD, you will find some apparent outliers, e.g. Arkema France (EUR) and BBA Aviation PLC (GBP).

freecashflows,21,Why A Hedge Fund Manager Thinks Tesla's Model 3 May Put Elon Musk Out of Business,"http://fortune.com/2016/12/02/tesla-model-3-stock-elon-musk

""Mark Spiegel, founder of hedge fund Stanphyl Capital Partners, says the Model 3—which Tesla CEO Elon Musk has promised to sell for as little as $35,000—may put Tesla on a path to bankruptcy before it even comes out.""

Presentation - http://www.tilsonfunds.com/TSLA-Spiegel-RH16.pdf

""Spiegel’s Stanphyl Capital manages $9 million, but has returned 35% ytd"" 

Tesla would lose at least $5,000 for every Model 3 it sells.

In order to sell the Model 3 at as low a price as $35,000 and still make a profit, Tesla would have to cut its production costs by more than half.

The obvious solution? Tesla needs to raise the price of the Model 3—to at least $50,000 for a bare-bones model, or 43% higher than the price currently promised, Spiegel predicts. “I wouldn’t be surprised if Musk claims a $35,000 base price but then never delivers any even CLOSE to that number,”

This new study provides some practical advice with regards to choice of automobile to those kids wanting to get into the game.

[Sensation Seeking, Sports Cars, and Hedge Funds](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2882983)

*Abstract:*

We find that hedge fund managers who own powerful sports cars take on more investment risk. Conversely, managers who own practical but unexciting cars take on less investment risk. The incremental risk taking by performance car buyers does not translate to higher returns. Consequently, they deliver lower Sharpe ratios than do car buyers who eschew performance. In addition, performance car owners are more likely to terminate their funds, engage in fraudulent behavior, load up on non-index stocks, exhibit lower R-squareds with respect to systematic factors, and succumb to overconfidence. We consider several alternative explanations and conclude that manager revealed preference in the automobile market captures the personality trait of sensation seeking, which in turn drives manager behavior in the investment arena."

WittilyFun,240,"Reddit, 1.5 years ago I left my job at a hedge fund to bridge the gap between Yahoo Finance and Bloomberg. Here is an update – and an awesome stock screener","**EDIT 12:50PM EST**: Server should be more stable now. Added more nodes and bumped connection limits. Thanks for bearing with me!

I hope you all are dealing okay with the market vol. I have some tools on the site to backtest portfolios if you it's helpful for you all. Also all news feeds are live so if you want to monitor things.


I write this to you all because I would say r/investing’s feedback has led 60% of the changes on the site. The flood of users 4 months ago led to so much feedback that I holed myself up and started re-coding the site for a few months. It was emotionally challenging work and you all were so kind with words of encouragement. Anyway, here we are 4 months later and with an update.

One thing I’ve been building in particular is a badass stock screener. With the advice of a few on this subreddit, a couple equity hedge fund managers, and a former analyst at Fairholme, I think I cracked it. 


You can see the screener here: https://www.tiingo.com/screen/o and more detailed explanations of how it’s different here: http://blog.tiingo.com/building-the-worlds-most-powerful-stock-screener-2/

**EDIT**: Please be patient with the screener, it's being hug-of-deathed right now and more complicated metrics may be a bit slower (20 seconds). 

Also The most frequent bugs right now are coming from custom-created metrics. The metrics typed in must match exactly what appears. I have to be super strict about enforcing this in order to protect the servers.

The jist is this:

1. Totally reenvisioned the UI for how we screen, from many textboxes to a drag-and-drop process to capture the idea of a screener being in an investor’s workflow.

2. You can create your own screening metrics, so if I don’t have one, you can use the formula builder. Because of the complexity of this, it may take an addition 5-10 seconds to get your results using a custom metric.

3. Since screeners show you stocks you’ve never seen before, simply click a company on the “Results” tab and a dialog will come up showing you a description, a price chart, and the latest news for that sock.

4. The screener integrates into the portfolio you set up on Tiingo – so you can see how every screened stock correlates to your portfolio. This can help find stocks that fit your screening thesis and also provide the most amount of diversification.

5. I have a couple metrics not available elsewhere, like when you screen by benchmark/Index, you can see the weighting of that stock within that benchmark/Index. You can also screen based on correlation to macro factors (Stocks, bonds, gold, oil).

6. You can actually see the values of the metrics you screened for and also export to Excel/CSV.

Note: Right now the site is made for mobile, except the screener. It may be a bit difficult to use in mobile if not in landscape mode.

I hope you all enjoy the screener!  

Below are some more updates I attribute to users on this sub.

-------------

The changes you all asked me to make were so incredible, once I implemented them, I started getting media attention. I really do mean that. If you want to see what the first iteration of the site was, check it out here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uq2TAU7MLjc

Anyway, a trading magazine covered Tiingo in its cover story next to a company worth over $700mm. A second CEO of a media company gave a shout-out in her keynote at a conference twice.   A couple HF managers are advertising Tiingo’s risk systems in their decks and I may soon have my first equity hedge fund client who is replacing his Bloomberg terminal with Tiingo. The goal is to make this project affordable to all with a “set your own price” model.  

I cannot thank you all enough for your kind words. Seriously, even when the site looked super shitty, you all were encouraging.

Feel free to check out other portions of the site. The portfolio tracking now has correlation calcs, beta calcs, and backtests. There is 10+ years of structured fundamental data for 4,800+ stocks and I have a risk parity tool.

If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them :)

Hello (Username removed), it seems that we've got some misunderstanding here. Let me try to clear some things up:

> You believe that you cannot time the market. You will always lose.

In my opinion a person who is not devoting full-time hours to investing or trading will not be successful on a risk adjusted basis. Absolutely in no way at all whatsoever do I believe that *no one* can beat the market, because that would be silly. Rentech, Berkshire, Soros, Dalio, etc etc have all proven the market is beatable, but those guys are some of the smartest people I've ever heard of, and they've devoted their *lives* to beating the market. Soros once described that he knew something was wrong in his portfolio when his body would start physically hurting, and that's the kind of dedication that I think it takes to beat the market.

> You believe that you should only buy low-cost, index funds. You will always win.

Because I believe that a person who is not devoting full time hours cannot beat the market, then the best option for them is to participate in the growth of the market. The best way for them to do this is to buy a broad index with low fees. I don't know anyone that would disagree.

> You believe that if you trade at all, you are a gambler and an idiot and you are doomed to fail.

If you have a full time job not related to investing, and you want to make some extra money by actively investing, and you're willing to spend something like 15 hours a week doing so I believe it does not make financial sense to do so. Check out [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1xpl9m/how_time_consuming_is_working_the_stock_market/), I actually made a spreadsheet that details the hourly wage you'd get by actively investing 10% of your portfolio and achieving an extra 3% returns over 25 years. At the end of the day, you'd have made $6.91 an hour, and you'd have had to spend 19,500 hours even for that meager privilege. You literally could have made more money working at McDonalds.

If a person thinks they can just gut-buy a bunch of stocks without deep and detailed research because they are ""Buying what they know"", that is gambling, yes. If a person thinks that they can spend 15 hours a week reading some WSJ articles and looking at the balance sheet to find undervalued companies, they are misguided. If a person thinks that investing is some magical thing that allows them to make tons of money without huge amounts of work, they are wrong.

To be clear, if someone just wants to learn about investing, or if they are doing it for fun with a little spare money they had on the side, then that's great, nothing wrong there. They need to be realistic with themselves though, what they are doing isn't really investing, it's making mistakes with stocks so they can learn the ropes. 

> Now reading your many comments, it is very apparent that you support these three statements.

I do not support these statements in the way that you've put them, so I hope this clears that up.

***

Now, you've asked specifically about me and what I do, so let me try to address that.

> What are you buying

There are many situations that take a huge amount of effort and expertise to understand, and therefore get overlooked by the market. The two PMs at my firm both have quite a bit of experience in finance, and one of them has experience in insurance. We have made money on some insurance companies that are in run off because the market wanted nothing to do with them (because they are no longer writing new business, and therefore there's no growth, and we all know how bad the market wants growth), which were therefore undervalued relative to their fundamentals. It took quite a bit of work, and some specialized knowledge relative to the insurance business, but they made out pretty well. 

> What risks are you taking

Have you read up on asymmetric bets at all? I don't want to get too detailed here for obvious reasons but we've done a lot of work on a company that is involved in some enormous legal battles, and we believe that the odds are great. Let's say there's a 50% chance it goes to zero, and a 50% chance it doesn't. If it doesn't, we believe that it is worth a multiple of its current price, and therefore that's a great risk to take.

Now here's what separates us from the guy reading articles. My PM worked with multiple lawyer contacts that he knows, two of them specifically involved in law related to the company, and one specifically involved in law directly involving the company. The other PM flew to NY and went to a conference that hosted a number of nationally renowned figures in law who spent the day discussing the legal situation. I actually called the DC clerks office and put together a legal timeline so that we could accurately discount our investment based on the number of years we expected it to take to work out. We did *original research*, stuff that the retail guy at home would never do. When we claim that we understand the company better than the market does, we actually have some credibility in that claim, unlike Joe Schmoe who read about it in the WSJ but never even opened the 10K.

Of course there is always risk when making an investment. We take risks that we believe make sense from a money-risked / money-to-be-gained perspective relative to what we could have invested in through an index fund.

> where do you think the market is going in the next year

That's not what we do. We find companies that are undervalued, period. We are willing to hold those investments through a downturn because we know that we've done the homework, and as Graham said ""in the long term the market is a weighing machine.""

***

I'm sure that I've left some things out, or been unclear in places. Feel free to ask questions.

Also I certainly wouldn't mind if this post got some upvotes, if one person is thinking it I'm sure many others are as well. EDIT: <<< The upvote statement here was related to the original post that was getting downvoted, not the post that I made."
FlipmodeSquaaaaad,31,How to start a hedge fund or an investment fund,"Hi everyone!

I'm looking for some serious help into how I can open and operate a hedge fund or an investment fund.  We want to do things like various forms of investing capital, managing money and possibly offer financial instruments.  Basically I want to figure out the best way to structure the company to give us (my partners and I) flexibility to invest in all sorts of assets with our capital.

For example, We would like to offer people 1 year 8% or 10% notes, and use the money they give me to invest in things such as tangible real estate, possibly ETFs or securities etc.

I know its not a simple task, but any pointers on where to start or what steps to take would be great.  I need to figure out what I need to become a small fund/company.  I want to know what type of licensing and what I would need access to, so that we could do this.

For some background, I have degrees in Econ, Finance and Accounting including masters and MBA.  I do various forms of investing including managing and investing in real estate.  My business partners and friends have a loose informal group where we share ideas for investments and track our progress.  We have a track record and have investors interested in our investments and ideas.  At this point we want to pool our capital, go legit and start a company/fund and possibly branch out to help people earn money like us.  My partners have varied backgrounds including wall street, finance, real estate, and owners of small businesses.

Reason for my question is that after doing some research, its hard to come by a comprehensive guide to actually get the ball rolling.

Thanks!   Appreciate the help!"

zaoldyeck,4,"""Iraqi"" hacker targeted US Hedge Fund known for shorting and publishing reports on fraudulent Chinese companies.","So this is interesting.  [Muddy Waters Research](https://twitter.com/muddywatersre/status/987546286210535424) headed by Carson Block has just had its website taken down by a group apparently claiming 'Shia Iraqi' allegiance.  ([""hacked by SaTtAr_iQ""](https://www.google.com/search?client=ubuntu&channel=fs&ei=6-TaWvC-DsSg0wKvs4KADA&q=%22HaCKeD+by+SaTtAr+iQ%22+&oq=%22HaCKeD+by+SaTtAr+iQ%22+&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160k1l2.43488.43488.0.43764.1.1.0.0.0.0.202.202.2-1.1.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.202....0.IAi9X2KMWE0), whose twitter profile says 'professional security', Iraq.)

A few months before in December they'd just published a rather long (and fairly well written, shame I didn't save it) report on [CIFS](https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cifs) currently trading on the NYSE.

Since that report came out CIFS's stock has taken a pretty heavy blow. (From 1.3B to 500M today)  This weeks ago, however, CIFS stopped a long run of bleeding losses a week after they claimed they'd [investigate](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/china-internet-nationwide-financial-services-inc-comments-on-recent-stock-price-movement-20180410-01239).

And then all of the sudden the MW website is taken down by an ""Iraqi"" hacker.

That... kinda implies a lot.  Is this normal?  Do 'hackers' often target research firms like that?  I haven't heard of it before, let alone stumble upon it myself.

Also, doesn't this kinda imply that shorting the stock is a good idea?  Wouldn't this be the kind of action to backfire spectacularly? 

I'm assuming, of course, that an Iraqi hacker has no interest in targeting a US hedge fund known mostly for shorting Chinese companies and from what I could tell (the site was working last night) had never mentioned a single middle eastern company.

Though there appears to be a group of hackers known as [MuddyWaters](https://www.cyberscoop.com/muddywaters-trend-micro-middle-east/) that appears to be Iranian based.  Which... I think is a coincidence but a profoundly weird one, especially given the [Chinese parts that were seen as false flags](https://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/campaign-possibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-central-asia/).  (""MuddyWaters"" is referencing a [*Chinese*](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=zh-CN&u=http://chengyu.t086.com/&prev=search) proverb no less)

Honestly, I don't know what to make of it.  Just think the entire thing is kinda hilarious and absurd in its own way.  At least I would if I didn't find it a bit scary that the Chinese government would pretend to be middle eastern hackers to shut down US websites spreading information about fraud.  Kinda has bad implications. 

Is this kind of stuff normal?  Has anyone else ever stumbled on something like that?

Disclosure: Fully considering shorting CIFS just for the hell of it.  But more looking for someone who can make sense of that absurdity."

Also, for mutual funds (or hedge funds for that matter), are customers simply billed for management fees?

dontfightthefed,95,On the performance of hedge funds vs. index funds,"Upfront disclaimer:  I am an engineering student at an American university who is currently an intern at a bank.  I have been obsessed with finance since my senior year of high school, and plan on working in finance after college.  This is a throwaway account because I prefer to have very little personal information on my actual account for privacy reasons.

I joined the investing subreddit a little while ago, and have pretty much been a lurker minus a few posts here and there.  I would like to use this post to discuss the widespread negativity towards hedge funds.  I am a bit biased in that I would like to work for a hedge fund one day, but I will try to be as objective as possible and am by no means claiming that I am right.  I would just like to provide the other side of the argument:

As I’m sure most of you know, we have seen an unprecedented expansion of the monetary base by the Federal Reserve since 2008 known as [Quantitative Easing]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantitative_easing).  Since the bottom of 2009, the S&P 500 Index has increased in value from [676 to 1683](http://i.imgur.com/VN4UXsn.gif) (as of 4:00pm ET), which is a return of almost 150%.  

There has been an increasing amount of scrutiny from both news outlets and retail investors about the hedge fund industry, and how the returns do not justify the exorbitant fees.  Many examples use the industry's performance against the S&P 500 as proof that they are not worth the money.  It is very much true that the hedge fund industry has under-performed the stock market in recent years.  [This graph](http://i.imgur.com/h38Ly1v.gif) plots the most widely used proxy for hedge fund returns from [HFRX](https://www.hedgefundresearch.com/hfrx_reg/index.php?fuse=login_bd) against the S&P 500 since the bottoms of 2009.  However, that is not a reasonable comparison.  Some hedge funds are long-biased equity funds, but most are not, which means comparing returns to the S&P is in many cases comparing apples and oranges.  

By definition, hedge funds are ""hedged"", which means they have positions that ideally benefit from both upward and downward swings in the markets.  Although many still do outperform the market during up years, it's the down years in the market that hedge funds tend to provide the most [alpha](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/alpha.asp), which is a risk-adjusted measure of performance against a benchmark.  The most recent crash is a great example of this; [here](http://i.imgur.com/Z8DhUJZ.gif) is a graph of hedge fund returns vs. the S&P 500 during the heights of the financial crisis.  As you can see, the S&P 500 reached less than half of its value from the peak, while overall hedge funds never went below about 77% of their peak.

Looking further in the past to 1998 (the first full year the HFRX Index existed), we can see that hedge funds have [pretty handily outperformed](http://i.imgur.com/AfKKM4s.gif) the wider stock market, even after fees.

So what has caused hedge funds to perform so poorly recently?  Well, for starters, the markets are becoming more efficient every day, and it is much harder to find low-risk-high-reward trades today than it was even 5 years ago.

However, the cause of most of this lack of alpha is undoubtedly the intervention of the Federal Reserve in the markets.  Institutional investors tend to have greater returns during periods of higher volatility, and during times where individual stock picks do not correlate very closely with the broader market.  Since the financial crisis, the correlation of individual stocks with the broader market has gone from a range of 40-60% to a range of 60-80%.  [Here is a graph](http://i.imgur.com/rjJjUta.png) of the implied correlation of stocks within the S&P 500 since 2007, with the beginning and end of each round of Quantitative Easing labeled for convenience.  

During periods of QE, hedge fund traders have a harder time gaining any kind of edge unless they try to predict the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve, since that is the major driver of the market.  Since the S&P 500 Index has performed so well with the extra liquidity, and so many of the assets that make up the index have moved in tandem with it, institutional investors have had a very hard time finding that edge that they charge the big bucks for.

So, in conclusion, I believe the data shows that the recent abysmal performance of hedge funds relative to the stock market is a result of the extreme outperformance of equities and the high correlation between assets.  I also believe that hedge funds will definitely see a reduction in the fees they will be able to charge over the next few decades, but the top funds will most likely still be justified in making fortunes in the markets.

This post is intended to hopefully dispel some of the myths that have been thrown around in this subreddit, but also to start a conversation about actively vs. passively managed assets.  Please criticize anything I say that you disagree with, but try to provide some sort of evidence for your claims so I don't have to Google around too much, and so I can hopefully respond with something equally insightful.  Thanks!

**EDIT**: I knew I would screw something up in this.  My graph of the implied correlation of stocks doesn't have QE3 labeled.  It started in September of 2012 and is still going today.

**EDIT2**: Some people have correctly pointed out that Hedge Funds are not necessarily ""hedged"".  I don't know why I phrased it the way I did, because Hedge Funds are such a broad category nowadays that they aren't necessarily hedged at all.  I should have said Alternative Investment funds."

hedgefundaspirations,67,There's a frustrating misunderstanding of hedge funds (and a lot of hate for them to go along with it) on this sub.

Please try to actually understand them before passing unfounded judgement.,"[The ABCs (alpha, beta, cost aka fees) of hedge fund returns](http://corporate.morningstar.com/ib/documents/MethodologyDocuments/IBBAssociates/ABCHedgeFundReturns.pdf)

""Hedge fund"" is an incredibly broad term that can be applied to strategies ranging from trading nothing but bonds to nothing but stocks to nothing but foreign bespoke options strategies. They all have extremely different risk/return profiles, and the it would be idiotic to compare the returns alone of aggregate hedge fund industry to the return of the S&P 500. If you want to compare the two, you have to do so either on a risk adjusted basis (like Sharpe), or a correlation basis (alpha). We need to get that through our heads.

It's exceedingly frustrating to see misleading (at best) and blatantly false articles bashing hedge funds get bandied about with bunches of upvotes from people who don't know better around here. Of all the places on reddit that Wall Street and anything associated gets bashed, I think we should be at least somewhat more understanding."
Hopschgen,1,leveraged value-orientated track record for opening a hedge fund in the distant future?,"Dear fellow redditors,
first of all, I highly appreciate you taking your time and making an effort to contribute something to my question, as I highly value your opinions.Additionally, I want to apologize for writing so much, but I want to make completely sure that my position is understandably represented. First of, I am sure a caveat to this provocative title is appropriate to calm your probably existing and very understandable anger or doubts: I am definately NOT thinking about opening an hedge fund in the near future and I take the responsibility regarding such endeavours very seriously. Dealing with other peoples hard earned money is extremely dangerous, requires (or should require at least) high ethical standards and should only be done if the capability of the person doing it can be assured to a satisfyingly high degree. My great role models regarding moral behavour and competence in the field are Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger, Prem Watsa, Seth Klarman, Walter Schloss etc. Because of all this, I am working as hard as I possibly can to gain all the knowledge and experience possible and establish a long term track record to finally prove my investment philosophy under real world conditions with high enough probability of continued success in the future. 
Therefore, I am thinking about 5 years of a verified, real money account track record. It is evident that the longer the period is, the better, but in terms of this I think you have to find a reasonable 	compromise between a long enough track record before starting the fund and an acceptable waiting period to finally start it.
My questions are:
1) Are 5 years sufficient as a track record ? In the end, I am sure to continue to invest either way, so if that was not enough I would simply wait a few more years.
2) Regarding the track record itself: is it sufficient to just invest with my private, real money Interactive Brokers account or do I have to make any arrangements to increase the record´s credibility ?
3) My approach is value-orientated, long-only, high on business analysis, long-term and bottom-up. My orientation is the mentioned investor group above. But as I am relatively young and having little money, I am currently using very long term  In the money options ( LEAPS ) to get some leverage.
Regarding results, it works perfectly fine and I diversify adequately, buy as I mentioned just conservative ITM calls and try my best to minimize losses.
To clarify, I dont really doubt making the neccessary, risk-adjusted profits, but I am not sure whether a leveraged track record is convincing for potential investors. So, if I invest for 5 years with LEAPS and do just fine, is this a potential problem and will the leverage devaluate or nullify my track record ? I am concerned that all the years might be totally wasted and people might not accept my record. On the other hand, I want and need some conservative leverage as I do not have a lot of personal money yet and the benefit is enormous for my personal portfolio. If there is absolutey no way around an unleveraged track record to be ""bulletproof"", I might need to open an additional, small account and invest in this simultaneously to my real bigger account. The problem is just that then my smaller account might just contain very little money at the beginning (1000$, at most 2000$) since I want to continue with the vast majority in my major account.

Perhaps by the unlicensed investor forming an LLP or other form of company for the fund and designating himself as the CEO but making the licensed guy some position under him, occasionally calling him into the office and paying him $2,000 or so to place an order?

""Adherence to (1) investing in highly liquid, exchange-traded options,
(2) focusing on selling and buying S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 indices
options and other related options that are consistently mispriced,
(3) mitigating risk by (a) maintaining an average expiration date for
the total options portfolio of between 3 and 15 days and a very short
investment horizon of less than 25 days, (b) daily assessing the impact
of market changes on the premium of the existing options portfolio, (c)
typically maintaining off-setting “delta neutral” positions for a portion
of the short-term, “sold” positions, and employing risk mitigation
hedging techniques as appropriate. Furthermore, the vast majority (over 80.0% at
any point in time) of the options contracts employed by this strategy
are “short” (sold) Put and Call options as opposed to “long” (purchased)
Put and Call options.""

Why would they do this? Doesn't this limit their own earning potential (presuming they take a cut of AUM)? They have near 30 billion in total assets, do they feel that this is too much for them to find good investment vehicles?

It just seems surprising to me that, considering that their income is some percent of AUM, they wouldn't be willing to accept more capital, and thus increase their own income."

A few points of attention:

- Every fund manager started with ~$10,000. 
- As some fund managers had more than 1 stock, I divided the $10,000 equally over the two or three stocks.
- As not all stocks are denominated in USD, you will find some apparent outliers, e.g. Arkema France (EUR) and BBA Aviation PLC (GBP). 
- The results under *unrealized (%)* do not take into account fluctuations in currency fluctuations; the stocks are presumed to be hedged for currency risk. 
- It appears as if my broker has stopped supporting Woolsworth Ltd. Ironically, on November 19, 2015, Woolsworth Ltd. was trading at AUD 23.61, which is exactly where it is today. Thus, the result of Woolsworth Ltd. (0.00%) – by lucky incidence – appears to be right.

apoptosis66,3,How to evaluate a Hedge Fund with tax consideration.,"Say there is a hedge fund that aims to meet or beat the S&P 500 after fees, and appears to do so by 2-3%, and it maintains a beta < 0.4 with lower volatility to S&P 500.  It all sounds good right?

However, because its a hedge fund you pay capital gains on all earnings each year.  The fund is about 80% short term, 20% long term.   And say I am in the highest Tax rate of 39.6%  these means its effective tax rate is (0.2 * 0.25) + (0.8 * 0.396) = 36.68%.    Where as if your just in the S&P 500 index your only going to pay capital gains each year on dividends (Not sure what percentage that is).  Regardless your just bleeding taxes, so does the 2-3% with lower volatility matter?

I realize your going to pay taxes someday when you withdraw, but maybe when your retired you will be in a lower tax bracket.  Anyways there are lots of variables but it seems to me like paying capital gains every year on investments really kills hedge funds."

He had a reputation for playing it safe and not making any rash bets that could cost him all of his money if he was wrong.

free_cot_data,14,Have you ever wanted to see how hedge funds or commodity producers/users are positioned in the futures markets? Introducing Free CoT Data,"Hey r/investing, I've anonymously browsed this subreddit for a while and want to show you a new site I've made public. There's nothing in it for me (completely free, no ads, no signups), it's just a tool I've personally used for years that I think might help some other people out.

I spend a large amount of time analyzing how different types of traders are positioned. If hedge funds are super short the S&P, if copper miners have fully hedged their future production, etc. I use something called the Commitments of Traders (CoT) report for this. The CoT report is released each week by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reveals the trades made by different types of market participants.

Some people make the mistake of only looking up the current CoT report and seeing if a category like money managers are net long or net short. With this approach, you fail to get context for whether their current position is historically extreme or not. 

I like to identify historical extremes because it prevents me from entering into a crowded trade. If my other fundamental or technical analysis gives me a bias to be short the S&P, but I check CoT data and money managers are more net short than they've ever been in the past five years, then maybe I should hold back on my short. Typically, when money managers get extremely short something, the trade gets crowded and has the potential for a violent short covering.

In addition, I like to know how commodity producers and users are positioned. These are the people who have a cash interest in the underlying commodity business. If I develop a long thesis on wheat, but I see that wheat producers & users are in aggregate extremely net short wheat, I might want to avoid going long. 

Check out the ""How To Use"" page on the site to see how I analyze CoT data to make it actionable information. I'm happy to answer any questions in the comments section

b_h_w,17,A former hedge fund trader said to short Japan,"A few months ago I was meeting with a client who is a former hedge fund trader (he's still a trader, but in a different capacity) and we got talking about Japan. He mentioned that one of the biggest opportunities he saw was to short Japan. We didn't get into any real specifics, but he pointed to Abenomics, a rapidly aging population and 100% dependence of foreign oil as three major factors.

I know the basics of shorting and how hedge funds work, but what might shorting Japan mean specifically? Is that something only a hedge fund or wealthy investor can pull off? Or are there small things that can be done on an individual level too? Maybe shorting bonds? Shorting T.S.E. stocks that are particularly susceptible to big shifts?

I have a track record for the last 17 months of performance from a personal trading account and am extremely interested in starting my own fund. Would anybody have any advice on what I should do? I am looking to raise money from friends and family to start my fund, would anybody have any advice on if this is possible from a legal perspective and any other advice on just raising capital in general? I consulted a law firm and they wanted to charge me about 40k just to draw up the documents incorporate the entity.

(Maybe I am naive and have not utilized the infrastructure properly but personally I do not see any advantage from a trading perspective being at a bulge bracket bank or hedge fund.

**Anatomy of the 10k**, by WSO user BlackHat, a Hedge Fund Portfolio Manager

I encourage you to go to the actual thread, he answers questions in the comments.

***

""Still jet-lagged by 8 hours from a day and a half in London, I haven't slept for a good 48 hours and remembered I owe WSO my process for dissecting a 10-k in the usual form. Before I get right into it, keep in mind every business is different and that will dictate the way you should read their specific annual report. What might be important to look at for an oil & gas company might be completely ignored for a hardline retail company, so don't take this as gospel when your PM tells you to get up to speed on a company and you remember the stupid shit old BlackHat told you was right and you end up missing something crucial to making an investment decision.

So with that, here is a full breakdown of how I like to look through a 10-K for the first time, what's important to focus on, and what can be glazed over (if anything) to save time and/or not confuse yourself. As always, I'll field questions afterwards if and when I feel like it to clear anything up.

**Business Description**

No matter how simple the business appears to be on the outside, I always go into researching a new business assuming I know absolutely nothing because chances are I do. On the cover page alone, I'll always highlight a few things: fiscal year end, headquarters location, and shares outstanding/market cap if included. Simple stuff, but I still do it no matter what.

Moving on, business description is the first portion of every K. Things that are surprisingly important to me include the history of the business and any historical changes in the company's defined reportable segments. The way a business perceives its moving parts is really important to understanding what they consider important. Sometimes management will decide to move from functional segmentation to geographic segmentation (or the other way around), or might simply consolidate segments or anything similar. I always want this in mind before I get into the granular aspects of the business so I have a frame of reference for how management looks at their own business. If I end up disagreeing it could be an interesting angle if we end up doing something activism-ish or if this may be a short candidate.

I always read the Business section in its entirety (note: I read every section in its entirety to be honest). Besides the things I've already mentioned, the obvious things to focus on are revenue breakdown by whatever segmentation they choose, key business relationships, and key business risks. The main things I'm trying to answer in this section are:

1) Where is the crown jewel of this business? I want to identify the cash generator/main earnings driver for the company. Most of the time this isn't going to be the same segment as what I'm looking for in #2, but it's very important to understand what the majority cash generator is for the company. Normally a company can't survive long enough without its bread and butter to develop any high-growth areas, so determining the key risks to it are just as significant as determining the catalysts to the explosion of another segment.

2) What is the major growth generator? Having a cash cow is great, but doesn't make for a compelling investment if it's growing top line at 1% annually. Normally management will make a point to highlight any major growth in a particular segment, but then again sometimes they won't. Always have this question in your mind when you're looking through segment information. If sales as a % of revenue have moved up from something like low teens to mid-thirties over the past few years, all the sudden you may have a good idea of where growth is coming from... or where a segment will have to pick up the slack as a crown jewel business starts to wither away...

3) Where are the key risks for #1 and #2? Section 1A will always list the risks to the business. A certain chunk of business risks seem identical in every company and can probably be skimmed, but firm-specific risks can be very important and disclose some important information. The things you can usually glaze over include the standard ""macroeconomic conditions"" clauses, litigation risks (unless it's a litigation-heavy business like a medical supplier, car company, airline, etc.), and key man statements. Specific things to look for might be in regards to expansion plans re: the growth engine and market share or other revenue losses re: the crown jewel. Management will usually outline what they think is scary about both of these things, and that will help you build a foundation for what you need to go out and investigate after you're done reading the K.

**Properties**

Skim through them, but usually not a big deal because there should be no surprises here. If it's a retailer and they provide historic square footage numbers, it's helpful to see how square footage has grown and you'll probably want to evaluate sales/sq. ft. over time to see how if the business has been able to grow its store base in an efficient way.

**Commitments/Contingencies (i.e. Litigation)**

Again, not particularly important for most but sometimes in lock-step with the business risks section, management might highlight a certain lawsuit or risk of lawsuit that could be make or break for the company. In those cases, obviously focusing on this section becomes a must. But when Kohl's has a $12M lawsuit hanging over its head in regards to a black woman's discrimination lawsuit after she got fired for shoplifting, you probably don't need to spend too much time figuring out what's gonna happen with that one.

**Market for Equity / Selected Financial Data**

The market for equity section should be pretty straight forward, and chances are if you decided to take a look at the company you already know where their stock has traded recently and if they have a dividend. Other times though you might want to at least skim over this to see if there could be any plans for a dividend or discontinuation of a dividend. Usually one of the more unimportant sections to me (except maybe Mine Safety Disclosures, haha).

Selected Financial Data is your first look at the actual performance of the business. I don't spend too much time here but I like to get an idea of the recent growth trends on the important line items, a sense of the margins at a high level, and anything particular that sticks out, like enormous one-time charges or a year where all the sudden everything fell off a cliff. These are really just things that quantify our idea of business risks, and hopefully we'll see these addressed later in the MD&A or footnotes. If not, we have some phone calls to make...

**Management Discussion & Analysis**

This, along with the notes to the statements themselves, are pretty much the bulk of the K for understanding what the hell is going on with a business. I spend a good amount of time scrutinizing this section and tend to re-read it once or twice before I feel like I'm actually done with that particular K. This is where the management team will outline their strategy and give a breakdown of what happened during the fiscal year. It's not uncommon for this section to be a way for the company to explain away their failures, or to pump a successful plan.

While I think this section is different for every company, the big things to watch for in getting acquainted with the way the business runs are 1) the important operating metrics that management uses to gauge performance, 2) any non-GAAP accounting that you might otherwise come across in an earnings release and be confused by, and 3) understanding the cash position of the business and seeing where any cash burn might be coming from. I always find myself playing the role of operator of a competitor, trying to scrutinize management's positions on everything they explain and coming up with a list of questions - no matter how basic - that I might have if they're still unanswered by the time I finish the annual report. This section also helps for providing some outlook and giving you better visibility/confidence in any projections you might make for an operating model.""

Ive been looking into hedge funds and have some questions. First of all, is there a way to invest in a hedge fund if you are not an accredited investor? Are any of you invested in hedge funds? If so, what has been your experience with them? Thanks,"
shane_stockflare,12,Daniel Loeb warns of hedge fund ‘killing field’ (FT article) & his latest Investor Letter (Third Point),"Here's a [link](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9e7ce258-0c8d-11e6-9456-444ab5211a2f.html#axzz476juU9Zm) to the article (paywall warning). And to his [Investor Lettor](http://www.thirdpointpublic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Third-Point-Q1-Investor-Letter-TPOI.pdf).

Highlights include:

> The first quarter was “one of the most catastrophic periods of hedge fund performance that we can remember since the inception of this fund,” in December 1996, Mr Loeb said. “There is no doubt that we are in the first innings of a washout in hedge funds and certain strategies.”

> New York City Employees’ Retirement System this month cut its hedge fund programme, citing a lack of transparency and exorbitant fees.

Drum roll ... the hedge fund industry defenders :) express outrage at the FT's bias!

And for any hedge fund haters, here's some [hubris](http://imgur.com/eJEV7jn) from the cover of Forbes last year.  Guess who they labelled ""Baby Buffett""?"
jeremymusicman1234,2,What do Hedge fund managers do with dividends?,"This may seem like a silly question. If a hedge fund doesn't pay a dividend, but they invest in a dividend paying stock, do they just add the profit to the NAV? Does the manager take a percentage of just appreciation of the fund, or of the total return?

What is the norm for investing for someone if you are taking a percentage of the return? Do you take a percentage of the dividends, or is that considered a bad practice? I know mutual funds pay out dividends, but am interested in funds that do not.

Thanks!"

Avis Budget Group had a tough second quarter, however.

Sabal,25,How do budding activist hedge fund managers start?,"All right, so the main point behind an Activist hedge fund is to buy stakes in companies, making internal changes to it so that the valuation of a company rises, and then eventually selling your stake off for a profit.

But, buying that initial stake can cost hundreds of millions of dollars. Take someone like a David Einhorn or Bill Ackman that started with $925,000. How are they going to go buy up enough stakes to become part of the board. Yeah sure you can use leverage but still?

Hopefully you insightful Redditors can clear this up."
sayitlikeyoumemeit,7,[Bloomberg Business] Buzzkill Profs: Hedge Funds Do Half as Well as You Think,"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-08-17/buzzkill-profs-hedge-funds-do-half-as-well-as-you-think  

This is going to be easy to attack, but I find it interesting nonetheless. Academics have attempted to remove the ""inherent biases in the way hedge-fund databases compile results"" and calculated that:

>The average annualized return for the industry since 1996 goes from 12.6 percent to 6.3 percent when the biases are removed from the data

... 

>The biases stem from the fact that hedge funds voluntarily report results to these databases.  The main reason they cough up the data is for marketing purposes, according to the paper, and funds generally begin contributing their returns once they have results worth bragging about. And since the funds include prior returns when they first enter the database, it leads to a “backfill bias” or “instant history bias” that boosts the average returns. 

I'm sure the way they have accounted for these bias is highly subjective, but the understanding the biases inherent in self-reported data is instructive."
Negotiation,6,Does the currency of a hedge fund matter?,"I've previously avoided funds depending on the currency they trade in. If I think the currency will fall, I'll find another fund instead. However, I've started wondering whether I'm approaching this wrong.

For example, if a hedge fund invests in Japan, it won't matter if it trades in USD, EUR or NOK, as it's currency fluctuations are based on the local (JPY) currency instead. Am I thinking about this correctly or is there something I'm not taking into account?"
