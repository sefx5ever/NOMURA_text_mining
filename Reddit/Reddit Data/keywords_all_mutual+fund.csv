2020-03-25,skilliard7,74,This crisis is a good example of why ETFs> Mutual funds,"With a mutual fund, you have absolutely 0 control over what price you buy or sell at. They only sell after market close, for whatever price it's at.

You can put in  sell order to sell 100 shares of a mutual fund, but with recent volatility, you don't know if that will be $10,000, $9,000, $11,000, etc. 

Technically, ETFs can differ from the NAV too, especially during times of economic crisis, but that's very clear when you sell or buy. You can put in a limit order and be fine.

With most brokers abandoning stock commissions, I can't think of a single good reason to use a mutual fund over an ETF. Prove me wrong."
2020-03-12,chargum,39,Many of my friends in the Investment Club are cutting their losses and selling all their stocks and mutual funds,"I belong to an investment club connected with a megachurch.  Most of the members are baby boomers. One of the main pieces of advice given to us by a wide variety of speakers is to not sell your stocks in a panic during a bear market or even in a huge market crash.  (Such as 2000-2002 or 2007-2009)  Instead, during a bear market, we should be buying stocks not selling them.

During the first 10 days of this crisis, we all were cocky and acted like this was not a big thing.  But as the stock market kept falling and it appeared our political and business leaders were failing us, more and more members of the club reported that they had sold most or all of their stock investments and went to bond funds.

Now the Bond Market has even turned against us.  During the last 5 days, I have seen drops in bond mutual funds that were more extreme than even the Great Recession.  Even ultra-short bond ETF's like GSY has dropped in value significantly.

Many members of the Investment club are saying- THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT- and wish they would have gone to all-cash 2 weeks ago but some are holding out selling because they are already down significantly and are too proud to move from paper losses to real losses."

2020-02-23,4ShotFed,8,Why would I want dividends? It is just forced liquidation and and a forced taxable event. Are there any good index ETFs or mutual funds that never pay dividends?,"If I am being an idiot here, feel free to destroy me but I fail to understand why anyone would ever want a dividend. 

If I am in a high tax bracket this year and next year I plan on being in a lower tax bracket, then I would much rather liquidate of my own volition next year instead of being forced to liquidate via a dividend this year. This problem applies to both ordinary and qualified dividends.

Furthermore, if you have automatic dividend reinvestment turned on, you are likely going to end up acquiring partial shares of the underlying security. Depending on your brokerage, these may incur fees or take longer to liquidate when the time comes.

Are there any index ETFs or funds that never pay dividends?"

The ETF went down about 5% yesterday, while the mutual fund only went down 1%.  The funds have what should be identical holdings, but the ETF can be traded intra-day, and the mutual fund traded at the end of the day.

2020-03-05,ilovehomeec,0,Purchased First Mutual Fund! Totally Lost Still..,"After a few weeks of studying on Mutual Funds I went ahead and zeroed out my savings account of $10,000. Its not a lot, I know, but it is what it is. 

I've been studying and studying about investments and mutual funds but there are still a plethora of questions I'm confused about that I can't find clear answers on. To be fair, it might not be clear as I'm still a novice in this.  
For example, I know I'm taxed on capital gains or when I receive dividends but to my understanding the capital gains (taxes) are only triggered when I **sell** the mutual funds. If I just park my money in there for 30 years, I won't be taxed at all, except on the funds that issue dividends, correct?

Another question I had was how I can reap my capital gains.  
For example, if a mutual fund does well and I want to sell it for some cash to use, how do I take advantage of the gains that fund might have experienced? Is my only option to sell the whole mutual fund/shares? IE. If I purchased 10K worth but now its valued at 10.5, is the only way to get my gains to sell everything?

Lastly, would I be taxed on sales that are under the initial purchase price? If I purchased 10K worth of shares in one MF but then I chose to just sell 6K worth, would I be taxed on the 6K even though the initial 10K investment was from a savings account that shouldn't be taxed?

2020-02-25,chargum,14,Bond Mutual Funds with a high percentage of junk bonds are interesting but scary,"I have been researching bond mutual funds for my retirement portfolio.

They seem great but I see that over 50% of their bond holdings are in junk bonds that rated BB or below.

Do you play it safe with your bond fund purchases - (with AAA  to BBB quality bonds) and get the standard 3% CAGR or do you play it a bit more dangerous and get a 5% CAGR with BB to C level bonds?

The safer choice= **FTBFX (Expected CAGR about 3%)**

The riskier choice but with a higher return:  **JMUTX or BMSAX (Expected CAGR of about 5-6%)**"
2020-02-20,I_am_Searching,4,Question on mutual fund / etf fees,"So, so many posts say to avoid fees like the plague.  But, I never understood the logic if the fund has a great 15 year return average.

Let's say a mutual fund has a 10% 15 year average return and a 1% annual fee (and assuming the 5 year average is also looking comperable). Then we could say the average 15 year return is 10% - 1% = 9%.

If we compare it with an ETF with a 15 year average return of 8% but a fee of 0.03%, the average annual return is roughly 8%.

Why wouldn't you choose the Mutual fund?  I understand not every year will be the same, but over time wouldn't you be better off?  At the moment 50% of my holdings are in high performance (but high cost MFs).

Can someone explain their reasoning?

Am I missing something obvious?"
2019-12-17,MasterCookSwag,207,Experience a large unexpected drop in your mutual fund recently? Read this before making your own post please.,"Every year in December we start to get 5-10 posts a day asking this question. Rather than have a ton of clutter in the sub I'm going to be stickying this post until the end of the month.

A mutual fund is essentially just a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever. Within that basket the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year(because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder). 

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash(and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution(except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. Etfs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds: 

https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/52943/2019-capital-gains-distribution-estimates

Ctrl + f your fund family. Chances are it's on one of these two pages. If not, google search ""______ funds capital gains distributions 2016""

Please note we'll probably be deleting any threads on the subject and pointing people here in order to keep the clutter down."
2020-03-16,Unsolicitedadvice86,0,Mutual Funds Trades if Market Closes,"Given that transactions for funds like VTSAX usually go through at the end of the day, what would happen if they halted trading for the day or for a few weeks?

2020-03-07,pamplemusique,0,What is the point of index mutual funds now that index ETFs exist?,"Been paying more attention to the market the last couple of weeks. I don’t believe I’m smarter than a bunch of equity researchers, so I just buy a few broad indexes. On multiple recent days I had a theory about what VTI should be worth and made a conscious effort to pay attention to its closing price in the last 10 minutes of the trading day to decide how much to put into VTSAX. It would have been so much easier if I had a limit order on VTI at what I thought it was worth and let that execute if it hit than to watch the market like that.

So given those dynamics, why should anyone invest in indexed mutual funds when comparable ETFs exist, like VTSAX over VTI? Is there some kind of protection in them that I’m not seeing that’s worth the ever so slightly higher expense ratio? Is the only benefit to mutual funds being able to buy $ amounts and not only entire shares?"

Jim retired on October 1st, 2007 and had 2 Million Dollars in his 401K retirement account and is using the 4% rule and is planning on withdrawing a starting figure of $6666 a month which will be adjusted for inflation. He has two accounts 60% of his money is in a total stock market fund and 40% in a total bond market fund. Just when he retires the stock market starts to crash so he pulls his $6666 a month withdrawal out of his bond fund so he does not sell his stocks when they are down. On March 1, 2009, just before the stock market hits bottom he has $955,736 in his total Bond Fund and $519,680 in his total stock market fund. ($1,475,416 combined) Starting in March 2009 he took his monthly withdrawals equally from both funds. On February 2020 he has $2,598,449 left.

Peter also retired on October 2007 and had $2 Million in retirement and put it all in a 60-40 Mutual Fund. On March 1st he had $1,164,377 in his Balanced 60-40 Mutual Fund (FBALX) He took an inflation-adjusted starting amount of $6666.00 a month out of that fund from October 2007 to February 2020. So, in the end, on February 2020 he had $2,489,195 left.

Why the difference? Because Peter used a balanced mutual fund that was selling stocks during the Great Recession (due to the investment having 60% in stocks). While Jim only withdrew from his bond funds during the 2007-2009 stock market crash.

I'm thinking some of the following:

 **SCHWAB U.S. LARGE-CAP GROWTH ETF** 

 **ISHARES S&P 500 GROWTH ETF** 

 **VANGUARD GROWTH ETF** 

 **VANGUARD TOTAL STOCK MARKET ETF** 

 **FIDELITY NASDAQ COMPOSITE INDEX TRACK**

In the PAST with my mutual funds, I would automatically put dollar amounts into my fund until I hit 6500 in a year.  Can I still do that with ETFs? I know for stocks you can only buy shares at the price.  My brokerage is with Fidelity.  Can I still automatically put in 6500 in my select ETFs without having to monkey around with trying to get my purchases at the ETF share price?"

VITAX - Vanguard Information Tech Index (MUTUAL FUND) vs VGT - Vanguard Information Tech (ETF) ?

Same expense ratio; very similar performance with YTD, 1-yr, 3-yr, 5-yr, and 10-yr; equal risk and exposure to volatility (I mean its the exact same fund); different minimums; dividends with ETF.

Assuming: 1)I meet the steep minimum for mutual fund (100k), 2) this would be a long term holding (greater than 10-20 years), 3) there is no need for this to generate passive income as I have 30 working years ahead with good salary, and 4) Stop Loss Order setup for possible future crash - Which is the better option and why?

2019-07-02,darkowa,301,My country is taking 30% of any profit or makes me invest in front-loaded actively managed mutual funds. What do I invest in now?,"See bottom for a tldr.

&#x200B;

So I live in Belgium and as a freelance software developer I want to invest with money from my company. I will not dive to deep into the personal tax situation in my country but simply put: any money I take out of my company to pay myself gets taxed close to 50% (depending on the amount).Since I can pay a bunch of things with funds from my company(house, travel, restaurants, clothes, car,...) it's a lot more efficient to leave the money inside my corporation.

So I read some books on how to grow that money and decided that something in the style of Ray Dalios all weather portfolio with global market index funds is probably the best way to go.I did some research and apparently my gov changed some rules that made it impossible for me to invest in stocks with corporate money. Here are the rules:

\- There is a 30% corporate tax on any profits. Since early 2018, this also applies to gains from the stock market. Any losses are not deductible.

There a few exceptions:

\- Investments over 2.5m are taxfree (well, 0.74% in stead of 30%)

\- Buying 10% or more of a company is also basically tax free

(spicy detail, these rules were reverse until early 2018 but fuck small business it seems)

\- Investments in a so called DBI-bevek fund is also free from the above tax.

So obviously I did some research in the various DBI funds that Belgian banks offer. Results for 3 of the biggest banks :

\- [KBC is the biggest bank, they have 3% frontload and 1.83% yearly fees](https://www.kbc.be/ondernemen/nl/product/sparen-beleggen/dbi-aftrek.html)

\- [Belfius is second biggest. The links to their funds are dead](https://www.belfius.be/professional/nl/producten/sparen-beleggen/liquiditeiten-lange-termijn/fondsen/dbi-bevek/index.aspx)

\- [Finally Crelan, they have 2.5% front load and 1.6% yearly](http://solutions.vwdservices.com/customers/crelan.be/screener/nl/Fund/BE6298866748-EUR)

&#x200B;

So basically I can choose, either I pay 30% yearly tax on profits without deducting losses or I pay heavy front load with heavy yearly actively managed fees.

&#x200B;

So my question is, what do I now?

Do I start a holding company abroad and move my money there. This comes pretty close to tax evasion probably.

Do I take the pain and just pay the actively managed fees?

Do I invest anyway and hope I can hold any index ETF until the law changes? Taxes are only due when I sell.

Do I invest solely in real estate? With investments in real estate the profits are taxed equally heavily but at least the costs are deductible(even interest on a loan is considered a tax deductible cost).

Is there another option?

**TLDR: Passive investing and individual stocks are basically not allowed in Belgium for small business owners. Do I take the pain of actively managed funds or are there alternatives?**"

2019-11-07,HunnyPig,11,National Bureau of Economic Research: Misclassification of Bond Mutual Funds,"Anyone have access to the full report? Below is the summary --> https://www.nber.org/papers/w26423

Don't Take Their Word For It: The Misclassification of Bond Mutual Funds

We provide evidence that mutual fund managers misclassify their holdings, and that these misclassifications have a real and significant impact on investor capital flows. In particular, we provide the first systematic study of bond funds’ reported asset profiles to Morningstar against their actual portfolios. 

Many funds report more investment grade assets than are actually held in their portfolios, making these funds appear significantly less risky. This results in pervasive misclassifications across the universe of US fixed income mutual funds by Morningstar, who relies on these reported holdings. The problem is widespread- resulting in about 30% of funds being misclassified with safer profiles, when compared against their actual, publicly reported holdings. 

“Misclassified funds” – i.e., those that hold risky bonds, but claim to hold safer bonds– outperform the actual low-risk funds in their peer groups. “Misclassified funds” therefore receive higher Morningstar Ratings (significantly more Morningstar Stars) and higher investor flows due to this perceived outperformance. However, when we correctly classify them based on their actual risk, these funds are mediocre performers. Misreporting is stronger following several quarters of large negative returns, and it is strong at the fund family level. We report those families that have the highest percentage of misreported funds in the sample."
2019-11-20,smango426,2,Question on taxes and liquidity between mutual funds and ETFs,"I have been invested into a few Vanguard index funds via their mutual funds for about a year now. I am considering whether to convert these to ETFs - apparently you can do this ""in kind"" without affecting your cost basis, but you can't go backwards. Regardless, this raises a few questions about mutual funds and ETFs that I haven't understood.

1. How are mutual fund capital gains taxed? My understanding is that unlike stocks/ETFs where you have individual shares, each of which you have owned for X amount of time and each of which has appreciated independently, with a mutual fund you just have put X amount of money in at different times and as the fund grows in value your portion of the fund is proportionally larger. There are no ""shares"", so if I have contributed $10K to VTSAX a year ago, and $10K to VTSAX yesterday, and today I want to sell $10K from VTSAX, how is it determined whether I am selling the original $10K contribution, the latest $10K contribution, some amount of the gains from the original contribution, or some combination thereof?

2. I have a related question about ""liquidity"" as it pertains to ETFs. In my original example, if I have a bunch of money in VTSAX and I am retired, I can withdraw some money from the fund every year to use as income. But if I have that money in VTI instead, I have to sell a whole number of shares for income. So if I'm not contributing any more, then my portfolio is presumably growing via the price of my VTI shares increasing, but that means that I am being forced to withdraw amounts which are increasingly different from the amount I truly want to withdraw (example: if an ETF is worth $10K in price now, and I want to withdraw $31K this year, I actually need to withdraw $40K). Over time your portfolio is going up but your ability to liquidate it efficiently is going down. In the (exaggerated) limit case, you're left with only a few super expensive shares. Is this something to worry about? Does this accurately describe a disadvantage of ETFs compared to mutual funds?

Thanks!"

Here was my goal:  Find a mutual fund that never had an annual loss for the last 20 years.  I found a number of them but most had a five-year return of under 1.5%.

YES, there are investments that over the twenty-year period made more money but were up and down and then up and down some more.  I get sick just thinking about it.  Instead, for my bond investments why not go with a mutual fund that has a 99% chance of going up in any individual year?

2019-10-07,chargum,1,Mutual Fund advertisement talks mostly about past return success!,"Certain Mutual Funds seem to do better than peer funds and beat the market- year after year after year.  They are advertised as successful investments because they have a history of success.

At the same time, many posters on financial message boards say past return is not an indicator of future results.  So I have ignored the successful mutual funds that have done well in the past.  But many successful funds then continue to do well and because I didn't purchase these ""successful in the past funds""  I lost money.

Maybe in the future, I will accept that ""many but not all"" mutual funds that have a track record of historical success will continue to do better than their peers in the future and I should invest in them.  An example of a mutual fund that has done well historically and will likely beat its peers in the future is FCNTX (Fidelity Contra)."

2019-10-25,victor0nl1n3,0,How do I see the holdings of a mutual fund?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently reading *The Little Book of Value Investing* by Christopher H. Browne. In this book, the author recommends:

*""As we build our inventory of value opportunities, we can do the same and observe what other value investors are doing. It is a fairly easy task using mutual fund-ranking services such as Morningstar. All managers must file a report of all stocks, bonds, and other securities in their portfolio at least twice a year. This is a gold mine of helpful information. These will be lists of stocks that the very best investors think are good opportunities for building wealth. As we look over these lists, we can find ideas that we may have overlooked in our search for inventory, or verify that stocks on our lists may be worth further consideration. Some of the names that have been in the portfolio for a long time may have appreciated significantly and are no longer value opportunities for us. Some, however, will be newer inclusions and may be available at around the same price that the best of the best acquired their shares. The manager reports also include the letters to shareholders, and these letters give us insight into the current"".*

While this sounds like a neat starting point, I'm not finding this info online.

So for instance, I looked on Morningstar and found a small cap value fund: NN (L) European Participation Equity - I Cap EUR \[ISIN LU1675869538\].

I looked on the fund's website ( [https://www.nnip.com/en-LU/professional/funds/detail/LU1675869538](https://www.nnip.com/en-LU/professional/funds/detail/LU1675869538) ) but I cannot find a list of holdings that goes beyond the top 10 nor can I find any letters to shareholders.

Anybody can help?

2019-08-13,newinvest236376,1,E-Trade Mutual Fund Thoughts,"Hello out there. New poster here and I could use some thoughts based in your prior experience.  There’s quite a few questions here so thanks in advance for addressing any where you may have some wisdom. 

First some background. I’ve been looking into the various platforms to invest in mutual funds. I’m open to ideas and came across etrade and I’m considering investing in aggressive growth mutual funds. I’ve got around $1,000 per month to invest (500 per paycheck). At 40 I’m definitely late to the retirement game but I’m fortunate enough to be in a position where at 53 when I “retire” from my current position I’ll have guaranteed pension of at least $80k per year for life (+ SS in my 60’s); that’s based on my current salary so it’ll probably be higher.  I’m looking at this investment plan to supplement that income.  Of course I intend to work a little but, PT, and be selective.  My only debt is a car payment and some CC debt which is paid in full every month. 

Therefore, I can invest the aforementioned $1k per month. The question is:  How do I do this? I assume I just open the account, set the money to auto deposit, pick the mutual fund, and be done. Is it that simple? I would ideally pick from one of the few thousand no fee funds they have. When I deposit the next amount of money does it to that prior picked fund or do I have to “buy” each time?  My plan would be to select the funds that are deemed most aggressive. I was thinking maybe three or four, does that make sense? Do I incur a fee with every deposit?  Maybe etrade isn’t the best option?  Since I’m asking so many questions would you recommend a robo investing platform for something like this instead?  If so, which one? 

I have a professional six figure job that requires an advanced business type degree but clueless on these issues.  As Denzel said in Philadelphia, explain this to me like I’m a two year old ok because there’s an element to this thing I just can not get through my thick head."

2019-08-23,freyzha,3,Quick clarification on the price of mutual funds as it relates to order timing.,"So, I'm aware that mutual fund prices are set once per day (typically near or after the end of day trading bell). What I'm a little confused about is how a price is associated with any given order.

Let's say that I initiate a $1000 order for $VTSAX at 1 pm, before the bell closes. The price of $VTSAX at the end of the day is $100, and my order is filled, meaning I receive 10 shares of $VTSAX upon execution and see that the next time my account is updated after all transactions are settled. Nothing fancy, and easy to understand.

Now let's say that I place an order for $VTSAX at 10 pm, after the price has been set at $100. Will I immediately have my order executed and receive 10 shares? Or, because the market has already closed, will my order be queued up and executed the next time that $VTSAX's price gets set, aka the end of the next trading day? Let's say that in this scenario, I initiate the same $1000 order at 10 pm, the closing price for the current day is $100, and the closing price for the next day is $200: **how many shares will I have when my $1000 order executes?**

2018-12-11,MasterCookSwag,289,"Experience a large unexplained drop in your mutual fund/ETF? Dont worry, it's normal this time of year. Explanations inside.","Every year in December we start to get 5-10 posts a day asking this question. Rather than have a ton of clutter in the sub I'm going to be stickying this post until the end of the month.

A mutual fund is essentially just a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever. Within that basket the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year(because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder). 

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash(and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution(except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. Etfs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.



Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.


Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds:

2019-04-15,waltwhitman83,5,"If you race to save $100k in mutual funds by 30, can you stop investing?","According to https://www.daveramsey.com/smartvestor/investment-calculator, if you are 30 retiring at 67 with $100k expecting a 10% return, you'll retire with $3.4m.

That probably isn't super realistic because as you age, you wouldn't be in something that 100% tracks the ""volatile"" market, but probably something more along the lines of a diversified portfolio with bonds. That would most likely drop the overly simplistic annual return rate of 10%.

However, it's also super unrealistic that from 30-67, you'll never contribute another dollar to your savings/retirement again.

How unrealistic is it to race to $100k by 30? I think I've read that the average American is probably woefully behind that, but I think across home equity/etc. the average American is probably pretty close to $50k-$75k net worth (excluding 30 year mortgage debt).

How unrealistic are 10% YoY returns? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index#Annual_returns quotes 10.53% from 1970 - 2018. I don't know if I'm incorrectly not adjusting for inflation."
2019-05-12,waltwhitman83,19,The age old question of real estate investing versus mutual funds for the average Joe,"I had an interesting conversation with somebody this weekend. They seemed to believe that:

1. mutual funds are extremely risky and you can lose all of your money because ""stocks are risky""

1. the bank would continue to give them lots of money to leverage yourself, as long as you put $10k-$20k down, get tenants, then prove the mortgage is covered via the tenants rent

1. he'd have access to ""wholesale real estate opportunities"". I felt this was tough because... the real estate market is like any market. There are people who do this full time with access to immense capital + connections. How would you average $40k-$60k/yr American citizen who has very little capital have any kind of upperhand or competitive edge against the real estate big boys?

1. eventually, he would have banking + CPA connections that would help him access all kinds of tax loopholes once he was at 2, 3, and 4+ rental properties. I personally didn't understand this logic because outside of: mortgage interest, property taxes, and repair / maintenance expenses (depending on how risky and fraudulent you want to get to the IRS...), what magic loopholes open up once you decide ""I'm an average citizen who wants to do rental properties""? or even ""I am an average citizen who has leverage properties, where's my tax loophole?""

I couldn't find the exact math to back it up but... after real estate appreciation (minus inflation), with very little vacancy / squatter / tenant issues, coupled with mortgage interest, paired with tax deductions, what is the average ROI for your typical middle class American trying to ""become a millionaire"" through either residential or commercial real estate / rental properties? Isn't it somewhere like 11-14%?

We all know the US market has historically yielded 10% with dividends reinvested, and about 7% after adjusted for inflation. I *think* I read that real estate works well because you leverage yourself by buying, say a $400k property with very little down, then get somebody else (tenants) to build equity for you. That yields a good ROI, I'm sure. However, there's obviously risk + headache involved. I do think that you are able to eek out an extra 3-4% compared to stock (somebody please let me know if it is much more than this, or in reality, less than this), but for more headache / potential risk (I get that stocks go down, but real estate property management is no walk in the park I'd imagine)

In my case, mortgage interest and property taxes wouldn't be greater than the standard deduction. Granted, that's for one property, not 4. I just don't know how I'd get a bank to give me 4 loans for 4 rental properties on my 1 salary income. Nor would I want to have that much open debt, lol

If you make $40-60k/yr and save up $20k, the bank might give you a $250-300k loan at maximum. Now, say you use that money to buy a rental property and you can prove for 12 months that you've had rental income under a contract, etc. When you go back to the bank for a second time (say with another $20k), do they give you *another* $250k-$300k loan? If not that amount, how much? Or do they not allow you to leverage like that?"

2019-07-27,CautiousInvestor,0,ETFs are strictly superior to their equivalent mutual funds.,"ETFs seem to have a whole bunch of advantages over mutual funds, with virtually no disadvantages. Granted, these advantages aren't huge, but since they are all stacked on the ETF side, it means you should **always choose the ETF** when both ETF and mutual fund vehicles are available for any investment.

Here are the advantages:

**Portability:**
You can always transfer an ETF between brokers. Not so with mutual funds. Brokers offer certain funds exclusively for their clients. Transferring those means you have to sell. That's a taxable 
event.

**Expense Ratio:**
At least on Vanguard (my main broker), ETFs are always a few basis points cheaper than their equivalent mutuals. Often you have to make a large initial investment, or you'll get an even worse ER. With ETFs, you can buy a single share and the ER will still be better than the best mutual that requires a large initial investment (aka Admiral Shares at Vanguard).

Here's a little comparison of ER (in basis points):

    Symbol | ETF ER | mutual ER
    ===========================
    VTI    |   3    |   4
    VXUS   |   9    |   11
    BND    |   3.5  |   5
    VT     |   9    |   10
    VSS    |   12   |   16

These differences are quite large, percentage-wise, with key funds like VTI being **33%** more expensive in their mutual fund form.

Also, these are all comparisons to the best class of mutual fund shares Vanguard offers (Admiral Shares). The gap versus regular shares is wider by a couple more basis points.

**Taxation:**
A complicated topic, and I don't pretend to understand it, but the bottom line is that [according](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090215/comparing-etfs-vs-mutual-funds-tax-efficiency.asp) to [all](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency) reliable [sources](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/etf-vs-mutual-fund-it-depends-on-your-strategy) I could find, ETFs are more tax efficient than mutual funds.

That's very important to a long-term buy-and-holder who is already at a high tax bracket due to regular income.

* * * * *

**Summary**

With several advantages and no known disadvantages to buying ETFs versus mutual funds, it seems the only reason to ever buy a mutual fund is when no appropriate ETF alternative exists. When such alternative does exist, it should be the preferred investment vehicle."

edit:

Yeah, my bad if I didn’t make this clear, but I mean buying ETFs specifically through M1 Finance though.

This means I can buy fractional shares, which eliminates the disadvantage of potentially having some cash “leftover”.

It also eliminates the advantage of being able to buy intraday, as all trades are done during a specific trading window.

I'm a fledgling investor looking to build my portfolio and have been looking into purchasing some shares of index funds. In my research, I have found that there is a way for mutual funds to be exchanged so that they don't count as shares being ""sold"" and thus generate realized gains subject to capital gains taxes.

My question is if ETFs can be exchanged in the same way, or if they will always have to be sold before the funds can be used to purchase different ETFs simply because they are purchased and sold like other stocks?  If this is not possible or advisable, what kind of tactics would there be to rebalance a portfolio?  I've been trying to research this question, but I might not be using the correct terms.

2019-04-25,Roboculon,4,An argument for buying stocks rather than mutual funds/etfs,"This is not about saving on management fees, it’s about tax loss harvesting. 

I never get to do it because all my funds and etfs are super diverse, and the market has been up the last few years, so none of my funds are down overall. But if I had a variety of individual stocks instead (even the same stocks I already have in mutual funds), I’d have the ability to sell them and realize the losses for tax benefits. 

In mutual funds there are individual holdings that go down, but they offer no tax benefit whatsoever, so the losses are effectively worse than they need to be. Using a loss to offset income is a huge effective reduction in the amount of net loss, and holding more individual stocks increases the odds you’ll get to do this.

Am I missing anything?"

I'm new to investing, and have read up a bit on index/mutual funds. A few people I know suggests to invest as much money as I can afford into mutual funds. Before I start dumping my money into them, I wanted to be certain on how exactly you make a profit, and the best way to go about doing so.   


With my basic knowledge on this subject, can anyone elaborate on how you actually make a profit aside from dividends?Would you recommend saving up money and buying x of shares all at once, or set up automated monthly payments and trickle buy a few share each month?  


I've read that having money in the market is always better, but for example: if you go the trickle method, and you bought 100 share at 1$. The stock goes up to 2$ per share. You made a 100$ gain, and it continues to stay at 2$. Now you're still buying more shares every month, 2$ each. Your average cost per share will slowly increase, which means you'll have a smaller profit margin each month. If every month you continue to buy at all time high, you'll eventually start to even out. Assuming no dividend payouts in this scenario, you won't actually be making a profit at all in the long run. So you actually would NEED the price to drop in order to profit?  


So in this scenario, time in the market isn't always better than holding off and buying when it's lower? Am I looking at this the wrong way? Thank you for any advice you can give."

I'm yet to start investing, but I have concluded that I should start with REITs or Mutual Funds. Maybe both.

The types of REITs that I'd look into are unique ones like WY. I've seen O mentioned so many times, so I'd look into it as well. As for retail REITs I'd rather not look into them because I personally think that retailers will not perform well over the next few years.

The reason I'm thinking of mutual funds is because it gives me a lot of stress to research individual stocks. To my limited knowledge I know that mutual funds are a pool of individual stocks and that you're able to buy/sell these funds as individual shares. What I don't understand about mutual funds is:

1. How does their prices go up/down? Does the fund manager buy/sell individual shares in the fund to maintain a healthy price on the market?

2. Perhaps not every mutual fund pays out dividends, but what would be the advantage of a fund that doesn't pay out dividends?

3. I'm assuming that there's specifc mutual funds,just like REITs. For example, a mutual fund that only holds tech shares, or industrial shares. Correct?

I have under $1000 to spend on starting my portfolio. I'm aware that mutual funds gives me more diversification, and that REITs are obligated to give 90% back to its shareholders. With my limited budget to start with, I will say that individual stocks won't be helpful for me at the moment. My mind-set is long-term, but in the near future I'd like to make money in the short-term as well, by maybe investing in growth stocks. "

So I would assume the only risk would be that VTSAX could considerably jump during that time frame when you're currently investing in VGLSX. And you would run the risk of buying in at VTSAX at a higher price than you sold it at. Is that risk not worth the possible reward?

2019-05-12,deslaur,1,ETFs vs. Mutual Fund – Total Fees,"Hi Everyone,

I've been trying to figure this out for a while but can't find too much regarding my question. We all know ETFs are more tax efficient than mutual funds, but is there a calculator to calculate the total costs of an ETF vs. a Mutual Fund? 

FZROX is a fidelity total market fund with a 0% expense ratio and no transaction fees, but has capital gains. ITOT is an ishare's total market fund that has no transaction fee but a .03% expense ratio. 

My math so far is that in a $10,000 investment, ITOT will have a fee of $3, but no capital gains. FZROX has had two capital gain distributions so far that amounted to $0.001 per share, the number of ""shares"" 10,000 would have is ~1,017, meaning the cap gains distribution is $1.01, 15% of that (long-term cap gains) is ~$0.15. That makes it seem like that with all costs included, FZROX is cheaper.

Is this the proper way to calculate this? Am I missing something? If it matters this is for a non-retirement account investment. 

Thanks in advance."

I'm aware of no load, front end load, back end load funds but I'm not familiar enough to understand fully which is the most useful? Is there some good advice where these different types are useful for certain situations?

Currently I do not own any mutual funds. I like the idea of mutual funds over single stocks because I feel they diversify well without having to know the specifics of every single one.

Also, what about tax situations? There are turn over percentages so basically there's short term gains constantly every year when filing taxes?

My ideal investing situation would be to buy now and hold long term. Any money I invest I'll have no reason to take it out.

2019-01-24,anikom15,0,The Mutual Fund Myth,"It all started with a statistic: 95% of mutual fund managers *for U.S. equities* over a *15-year period* did not beat the market.

This somehow got extrapolated to ‘mutual funds never beat their index’ to ‘fund managers never beat the market’ to ‘no investor can ever beat the market’. None of those statements are true.

There are a number of reasons why we end up with the 95% metric:

1. Nobody was expecting such a long bull market from 2008. It’s very hard to beat the market during a bull market.

2. *Mutual fund* managers have limitations to how they can run their fund and this can limit their return. Individual investors and private fund managers don’t have this problem.

3. Mutual funds may have different goals even within the same index. Certain active fund strategies can be more conservative by reducing investment in more volatile stocks and increasing investment in higher-yield stocks. The purpose is to reduce risk and generate more income (via dividends). However, this can stunt growth during a bull market (we have been in one of the longest in recent history).

4. Many actively managed *U.S. equities* mutual funds beat the market in shorter time periods. 15 years is a long time to be in a fund. Fund managers change and strategies change over the life of a fund. If you are going to invest in active funds, it is part of your DD to keep up with these changes.

**Mutual Funds Never Beat Their Index**

There are plenty of mutual funds that beat their index. Bond Funds in particular consistenly do better than their indices. Foreign funds have also done well and may indicate what ‘active vs. passive’ may look like in a not-so-bullish U.S. market.

**Fund Managers Never Beat the Market**

We really don’t know what private fund managers are doing, but they have much greater control over their funds than a mutual fund manager. Statistics on mutual funds aren’t applicable. Fund managers also have different goals for their clients. Growth is not the only objective.

‘You can’t beat the market’ is a myth and I will continue to invest in low-cost mutual funds with a good track record (5-yr/10-yr), stable management, and investing philosophies I support.

Edit 1: Edited point 3 to more clearly define fund strategies.

Edit 2: Made point 4 less ambiguous by specifying that U.S. equity funds that beat their index are actively managed. There is actually a slim possibility for an index fund to beat its index theoretically, however."

2019-01-04,akkruse,6,Help With Mutual Fund Fees,"TL;DR: what exactly am I holding in my account and what are the fees?

I had an Edward Jones account transferred in my name several years ago. I didn't know much about the market at the time, but I knew if I left the money in the account, it should grow (and it has). I've never deposited or withdrew from the account, I've just let what was already there continue to build. Today, I know more about stocks and ETFs, but not as much about mutual funds, and I was hoping you guys could help fill the gaps. FWIW I've asked the advisor some of these questions in an email, but she wanted to schedule a call so we could setup a WebEx meeting and look at charts (I didn't feel like all of that was necessary, I just wanted some quick answers).

Having said that, some of the funds are in ""American Funds Growth Fund of America A"" ($AGTHX) but the majority are in ""American Funds New Perspective A"" ($ANWPX).

I've read bad things about Edward Jones and their fees, so I was wondering exactly what fees I'm paying here. Here's what I think I've figured out about the fees:

- These both have a 5.75% ""load""
- These have expense ratios of 0.62% and 0.75%

I believe (but I'm not positive) these are ""front-load"", which means at the time the funds were originally deposited, 5.75% was already taken out for fees. Is this correct? And does this also mean that while I would have to pay this percentage if I added new funds, it's not costing me anything extra on the funds that are already there? In other words, this wouldn't be a reason to move the funds to a different account to save fees, but would be a reason to not add additional funds.

I'm assuming there expense ratios are ""normal fees"" comparable to the ERs of ETFs (nothing special about them being tied to a mutual fund), is this correct?

What other fees might there be beyond this? I've read about annual account maintenance fees, do those apply here (or how would I find out)? Since these are ""A shares"" (class A?), I've read ""back-load""/redemption fees and 12(b)1 fees don't apply, is this true? So does this mean the expense ratios are the only fees I'm currently paying (since I'm not adding funds and not incurring the front-load)?

If I'm understanding all of this correctly, then it sounds like I'm not getting charged any outrageous fees by letting this money sit in this account, and there's no real pressing reason I would want to move it out of Edward Jones to cut fees. I probably wouldn't want to add to this account because of the 5.75% (which might be reason to consider moving to a different account), but I'm not doing any harm to what's already there. Does this sound about right? Or are there other fees I might be missing? 

I realize these fees also get me the advantage of having an advisor, but honestly at this point I'm turning to Reddit for where the advisor has failed me. Thanks in advance for any help!"

2017-12-15,MasterCookSwag,524,"Experience a large unexplained drop in your mutual fund? Don't worry, it's normal. Here's the explanation.","Every year in December we start to get 5-10 posts a day asking this question. Rather than have a ton of clutter in the sub I'm going to be stickying this post until the end of the month.

A mutual fund is essentially just a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever. Within that basket the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year(because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder). 

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash(and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution(except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. Etfs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Please note we'll probably be deleting any threads on the subject to keep the clutter down.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.


Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds:

How am I taxed on these gains? I'm assuming it's short term capital gains, because I held the asset under 1 year.

The reason I'm confused is because perhaps Vanguard was holding onto the underlying equities for 10 years, so from their perspective any gains they realize are long term, but as someone buying shares of their investment vehicle, do I get to treat gains as long term, or does my timer start at 0 when I buy those assets regardless?

(Side-note, it was interesting to find out that fund distributions are always treated as long term: [https://www.irs.gov/faqs/capital-gains-losses-and-sale-of-home/mutual-funds-costs-distributions-etc/mutual-funds-costs-distributions-etc-4](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/capital-gains-losses-and-sale-of-home/mutual-funds-costs-distributions-etc/mutual-funds-costs-distributions-etc-4))
