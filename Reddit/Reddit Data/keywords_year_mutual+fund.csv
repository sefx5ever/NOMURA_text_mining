2020-03-25,skilliard7,73,This crisis is a good example of why ETFs> Mutual funds,"With a mutual fund, you have absolutely 0 control over what price you buy or sell at. They only sell after market close, for whatever price it's at.

You can put in  sell order to sell 100 shares of a mutual fund, but with recent volatility, you don't know if that will be $10,000, $9,000, $11,000, etc. 

Technically, ETFs can differ from the NAV too, especially during times of economic crisis, but that's very clear when you sell or buy. You can put in a limit order and be fine.

With most brokers abandoning stock commissions, I can't think of a single good reason to use a mutual fund over an ETF. Prove me wrong."
2020-03-12,chargum,40,Many of my friends in the Investment Club are cutting their losses and selling all their stocks and mutual funds,"I belong to an investment club connected with a megachurch.  Most of the members are baby boomers. One of the main pieces of advice given to us by a wide variety of speakers is to not sell your stocks in a panic during a bear market or even in a huge market crash.  (Such as 2000-2002 or 2007-2009)  Instead, during a bear market, we should be buying stocks not selling them.

During the first 10 days of this crisis, we all were cocky and acted like this was not a big thing.  But as the stock market kept falling and it appeared our political and business leaders were failing us, more and more members of the club reported that they had sold most or all of their stock investments and went to bond funds.

Now the Bond Market has even turned against us.  During the last 5 days, I have seen drops in bond mutual funds that were more extreme than even the Great Recession.  Even ultra-short bond ETF's like GSY has dropped in value significantly.

Many members of the Investment club are saying- THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT- and wish they would have gone to all-cash 2 weeks ago but some are holding out selling because they are already down significantly and are too proud to move from paper losses to real losses."

2020-02-23,4ShotFed,8,Why would I want dividends? It is just forced liquidation and and a forced taxable event. Are there any good index ETFs or mutual funds that never pay dividends?,"If I am being an idiot here, feel free to destroy me but I fail to understand why anyone would ever want a dividend. 

If I am in a high tax bracket this year and next year I plan on being in a lower tax bracket, then I would much rather liquidate of my own volition next year instead of being forced to liquidate via a dividend this year. This problem applies to both ordinary and qualified dividends.

Furthermore, if you have automatic dividend reinvestment turned on, you are likely going to end up acquiring partial shares of the underlying security. Depending on your brokerage, these may incur fees or take longer to liquidate when the time comes.

Are there any index ETFs or funds that never pay dividends?"

2. at what point should their price stop decreasing, considering there's no increase of interest?
3. unlike buying bonds directly, with mutual funds you can't hold to it until expiration for the interest and finally receiving back the initial fund. doesn't it make them much riskier? basically like a lighter version of stock mutual bonds?

The funds have what should be identical holdings, but the ETF can be traded intra-day, and the mutual fund traded at the end of the day.

2020-03-05,ilovehomeec,0,Purchased First Mutual Fund! Totally Lost Still..,"After a few weeks of studying on Mutual Funds I went ahead and zeroed out my savings account of $10,000. Its not a lot, I know, but it is what it is. 

I've been studying and studying about investments and mutual funds but there are still a plethora of questions I'm confused about that I can't find clear answers on. To be fair, it might not be clear as I'm still a novice in this.  
For example, I know I'm taxed on capital gains or when I receive dividends but to my understanding the capital gains (taxes) are only triggered when I **sell** the mutual funds. If I just park my money in there for 30 years, I won't be taxed at all, except on the funds that issue dividends, correct?

Another question I had was how I can reap my capital gains.  
For example, if a mutual fund does well and I want to sell it for some cash to use, how do I take advantage of the gains that fund might have experienced? Is my only option to sell the whole mutual fund/shares? IE. If I purchased 10K worth but now its valued at 10.5, is the only way to get my gains to sell everything?

Lastly, would I be taxed on sales that are under the initial purchase price? If I purchased 10K worth of shares in one MF but then I chose to just sell 6K worth, would I be taxed on the 6K even though the initial 10K investment was from a savings account that shouldn't be taxed?

2020-02-25,chargum,14,Bond Mutual Funds with a high percentage of junk bonds are interesting but scary,"I have been researching bond mutual funds for my retirement portfolio.  I have found a number with good returns (for bond funds) about 5% CAGR over the last five years that have a very low standard deviation and very low maximum drawdown.  They seem great but I see that over 50% of their bond holdings are in junk bonds that rated BB or below.

Do you play it safe with your bond fund purchases - (with AAA  to BBB quality bonds) and get the standard 3% CAGR or do you play it a bit more dangerous and get a 5% CAGR with BB to C level bonds?

The safer choice= **FTBFX (Expected CAGR about 3%)**

The riskier choice but with a higher return:  **JMUTX or BMSAX (Expected CAGR of about 5-6%)**"
2020-02-20,I_am_Searching,4,Question on mutual fund / etf fees,"So, so many posts say to avoid fees like the plague.  But, I never understood the logic if the fund has a great 15 year return average.

Let's say a mutual fund has a 10% 15 year average return and a 1% annual fee (and assuming the 5 year average is also looking comperable). Then we could say the average 15 year return is 10% - 1% = 9%.

If we compare it with an ETF with a 15 year average return of 8% but a fee of 0.03%, the average annual return is roughly 8%.

Why wouldn't you choose the Mutual fund?  I understand not every year will be the same, but over time wouldn't you be better off?  At the moment 50% of my holdings are in high performance (but high cost MFs).

Can someone explain their reasoning?

Am I missing something obvious?"
2019-12-17,MasterCookSwag,204,Experience a large unexpected drop in your mutual fund recently? Read this before making your own post please.,"Every year in December we start to get 5-10 posts a day asking this question. Rather than have a ton of clutter in the sub I'm going to be stickying this post until the end of the month.

A mutual fund is essentially just a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever. Within that basket the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year(because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder). 

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash(and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution(except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. Etfs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds: 

https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/52943/2019-capital-gains-distribution-estimates

Ctrl + f your fund family. Chances are it's on one of these two pages. If not, google search ""______ funds capital gains distributions 2016""

Please note we'll probably be deleting any threads on the subject and pointing people here in order to keep the clutter down."
2020-03-16,Unsolicitedadvice86,0,Mutual Funds Trades if Market Closes,"Given that transactions for funds like VTSAX usually go through at the end of the day, what would happen if they halted trading for the day or for a few weeks?

2020-03-07,pamplemusique,0,What is the point of index mutual funds now that index ETFs exist?,"Been paying more attention to the market the last couple of weeks. I don’t believe I’m smarter than a bunch of equity researchers, so I just buy a few broad indexes. On multiple recent days I had a theory about what VTI should be worth and made a conscious effort to pay attention to its closing price in the last 10 minutes of the trading day to decide how much to put into VTSAX. It would have been so much easier if I had a limit order on VTI at what I thought it was worth and let that execute if it hit than to watch the market like that.

So given those dynamics, why should anyone invest in indexed mutual funds when comparable ETFs exist, like VTSAX over VTI? Is there some kind of protection in them that I’m not seeing that’s worth the ever so slightly higher expense ratio? Is the only benefit to mutual funds being able to buy $ amounts and not only entire shares?"

Jim retired on October 1st, 2007 and had 2 Million Dollars in his 401K retirement account and is using the 4% rule and is planning on withdrawing a starting figure of $6666 a month which will be adjusted for inflation. He has two accounts 60% of his money is in a total stock market fund and 40% in a total bond market fund. Just when he retires the stock market starts to crash so he pulls his $6666 a month withdrawal out of his bond fund so he does not sell his stocks when they are down. On March 1, 2009, just before the stock market hits bottom he has $955,736 in his total Bond Fund and $519,680 in his total stock market fund. ($1,475,416 combined) Starting in March 2009 he took his monthly withdrawals equally from both funds. On February 2020 he has $2,598,449 left.

Peter also retired on October 2007 and had $2 Million in retirement and put it all in a 60-40 Mutual Fund. On March 1st he had $1,164,377 in his Balanced 60-40 Mutual Fund (FBALX) He took an inflation-adjusted starting amount of $6666.00 a month out of that fund from October 2007 to February 2020. So, in the end, on February 2020 he had $2,489,195 left.

Why the difference? Because Peter used a balanced mutual fund that was selling stocks during the Great Recession (due to the investment having 60% in stocks). While Jim only withdrew from his bond funds during the 2007-2009 stock market crash.

2019-07-02,darkowa,304,My country is taking 30% of any profit or makes me invest in front-loaded actively managed mutual funds. What do I invest in now?,"See bottom for a tldr.

&#x200B;

So I live in Belgium and as a freelance software developer I want to invest with money from my company. I will not dive to deep into the personal tax situation in my country but simply put: any money I take out of my company to pay myself gets taxed close to 50% (depending on the amount).Since I can pay a bunch of things with funds from my company(house, travel, restaurants, clothes, car,...) it's a lot more efficient to leave the money inside my corporation.

So I read some books on how to grow that money and decided that something in the style of Ray Dalios all weather portfolio with global market index funds is probably the best way to go.I did some research and apparently my gov changed some rules that made it impossible for me to invest in stocks with corporate money. Here are the rules:

\- There is a 30% corporate tax on any profits. Since early 2018, this also applies to gains from the stock market. Any losses are not deductible.

There a few exceptions:

\- Investments over 2.5m are taxfree (well, 0.74% in stead of 30%)

\- Buying 10% or more of a company is also basically tax free

(spicy detail, these rules were reverse until early 2018 but fuck small business it seems)

\- Investments in a so called DBI-bevek fund is also free from the above tax.

So obviously I did some research in the various DBI funds that Belgian banks offer. Results for 3 of the biggest banks :

\- [KBC is the biggest bank, they have 3% frontload and 1.83% yearly fees](https://www.kbc.be/ondernemen/nl/product/sparen-beleggen/dbi-aftrek.html)

\- [Belfius is second biggest. The links to their funds are dead](https://www.belfius.be/professional/nl/producten/sparen-beleggen/liquiditeiten-lange-termijn/fondsen/dbi-bevek/index.aspx)

\- [Finally Crelan, they have 2.5% front load and 1.6% yearly](http://solutions.vwdservices.com/customers/crelan.be/screener/nl/Fund/BE6298866748-EUR)

&#x200B;

So basically I can choose, either I pay 30% yearly tax on profits without deducting losses or I pay heavy front load with heavy yearly actively managed fees.

&#x200B;

So my question is, what do I now?

Do I start a holding company abroad and move my money there. This comes pretty close to tax evasion probably.

Do I take the pain and just pay the actively managed fees?

Do I invest anyway and hope I can hold any index ETF until the law changes? Taxes are only due when I sell.

Do I invest solely in real estate? With investments in real estate the profits are taxed equally heavily but at least the costs are deductible(even interest on a loan is considered a tax deductible cost).

Is there another option?

**TLDR: Passive investing and individual stocks are basically not allowed in Belgium for small business owners. Do I take the pain of actively managed funds or are there alternatives?**"

2019-11-20,smango426,2,Question on taxes and liquidity between mutual funds and ETFs,"I have been invested into a few Vanguard index funds via their mutual funds for about a year now. I am considering whether to convert these to ETFs - apparently you can do this ""in kind"" without affecting your cost basis, but you can't go backwards. Regardless, this raises a few questions about mutual funds and ETFs that I haven't understood.

1. How are mutual fund capital gains taxed? My understanding is that unlike stocks/ETFs where you have individual shares, each of which you have owned for X amount of time and each of which has appreciated independently, with a mutual fund you just have put X amount of money in at different times and as the fund grows in value your portion of the fund is proportionally larger. There are no ""shares"", so if I have contributed $10K to VTSAX a year ago, and $10K to VTSAX yesterday, and today I want to sell $10K from VTSAX, how is it determined whether I am selling the original $10K contribution, the latest $10K contribution, some amount of the gains from the original contribution, or some combination thereof?

2. I have a related question about ""liquidity"" as it pertains to ETFs. In my original example, if I have a bunch of money in VTSAX and I am retired, I can withdraw some money from the fund every year to use as income. But if I have that money in VTI instead, I have to sell a whole number of shares for income. So if I'm not contributing any more, then my portfolio is presumably growing via the price of my VTI shares increasing, but that means that I am being forced to withdraw amounts which are increasingly different from the amount I truly want to withdraw (example: if an ETF is worth $10K in price now, and I want to withdraw $31K this year, I actually need to withdraw $40K). Over time your portfolio is going up but your ability to liquidate it efficiently is going down. In the (exaggerated) limit case, you're left with only a few super expensive shares. Is this something to worry about? Does this accurately describe a disadvantage of ETFs compared to mutual funds?

Thanks!"

Don't Take Their Word For It: The Misclassification of Bond Mutual Funds

We provide evidence that mutual fund managers misclassify their holdings, and that these misclassifications have a real and significant impact on investor capital flows. In particular, we provide the first systematic study of bond funds’ reported asset profiles to Morningstar against their actual portfolios. 

Many funds report more investment grade assets than are actually held in their portfolios, making these funds appear significantly less risky. This results in pervasive misclassifications across the universe of US fixed income mutual funds by Morningstar, who relies on these reported holdings. The problem is widespread- resulting in about 30% of funds being misclassified with safer profiles, when compared against their actual, publicly reported holdings. 

“Misclassified funds” – i.e., those that hold risky bonds, but claim to hold safer bonds– outperform the actual low-risk funds in their peer groups. “Misclassified funds” therefore receive higher Morningstar Ratings (significantly more Morningstar Stars) and higher investor flows due to this perceived outperformance. However, when we correctly classify them based on their actual risk, these funds are mediocre performers. Misreporting is stronger following several quarters of large negative returns, and it is strong at the fund family level. We report those families that have the highest percentage of misreported funds in the sample."

The European version of treasury bonds is now negative. And the European Bond Market is crazy.

2019-10-07,chargum,1,Mutual Fund advertisement talks mostly about past return success!,"Certain Mutual Funds seem to do better than peer funds and beat the market- year after year after year.  They are advertised as successful investments because they have a history of success.

At the same time, many posters on financial message boards say past return is not an indicator of future results.  So I have ignored the successful mutual funds that have done well in the past.  But many successful funds then continue to do well and because I didn't purchase these ""successful in the past funds""  I lost money.

Maybe in the future, I will accept that ""many but not all"" mutual funds that have a track record of historical success will continue to do better than their peers in the future and I should invest in them.  An example of a mutual fund that has done well historically and will likely beat its peers in the future is FCNTX (Fidelity Contra)."

2019-10-25,victor0nl1n3,0,How do I see the holdings of a mutual fund?,"Hi everyone,

I'm currently reading *The Little Book of Value Investing* by Christopher H. Browne. In this book, the author recommends:

*""As we build our inventory of value opportunities, we can do the same and observe what other value investors are doing. It is a fairly easy task using mutual fund-ranking services such as Morningstar. All managers must file a report of all stocks, bonds, and other securities in their portfolio at least twice a year. This is a gold mine of helpful information. These will be lists of stocks that the very best investors think are good opportunities for building wealth. As we look over these lists, we can find ideas that we may have overlooked in our search for inventory, or verify that stocks on our lists may be worth further consideration. Some of the names that have been in the portfolio for a long time may have appreciated significantly and are no longer value opportunities for us. Some, however, will be newer inclusions and may be available at around the same price that the best of the best acquired their shares. The manager reports also include the letters to shareholders, and these letters give us insight into the current"".*

While this sounds like a neat starting point, I'm not finding this info online.

So for instance, I looked on Morningstar and found a small cap value fund: NN (L) European Participation Equity - I Cap EUR \[ISIN LU1675869538\].

Anybody can help?

2019-08-13,newinvest236376,1,E-Trade Mutual Fund Thoughts,"Hello out there. New poster here and I could use some thoughts based in your prior experience.  There’s quite a few questions here so thanks in advance for addressing any where you may have some wisdom. 

First some background. I’ve been looking into the various platforms to invest in mutual funds. I’m open to ideas and came across etrade and I’m considering investing in aggressive growth mutual funds. I’ve got around $1,000 per month to invest (500 per paycheck). At 40 I’m definitely late to the retirement game but I’m fortunate enough to be in a position where at 53 when I “retire” from my current position I’ll have guaranteed pension of at least $80k per year for life (+ SS in my 60’s); that’s based on my current salary so it’ll probably be higher.  I’m looking at this investment plan to supplement that income.  Of course I intend to work a little but, PT, and be selective.  My only debt is a car payment and some CC debt which is paid in full every month. 

Therefore, I can invest the aforementioned $1k per month. The question is:  How do I do this? I assume I just open the account, set the money to auto deposit, pick the mutual fund, and be done. Is it that simple? I would ideally pick from one of the few thousand no fee funds they have. When I deposit the next amount of money does it to that prior picked fund or do I have to “buy” each time?  My plan would be to select the funds that are deemed most aggressive. I was thinking maybe three or four, does that make sense? Do I incur a fee with every deposit?  Maybe etrade isn’t the best option?  Since I’m asking so many questions would you recommend a robo investing platform for something like this instead?  If so, which one? 

I have a professional six figure job that requires an advanced business type degree but clueless on these issues.  As Denzel said in Philadelphia, explain this to me like I’m a two year old ok because there’s an element to this thing I just can not get through my thick head."

2019-08-23,freyzha,3,Quick clarification on the price of mutual funds as it relates to order timing.,"So, I'm aware that mutual fund prices are set once per day (typically near or after the end of day trading bell). What I'm a little confused about is how a price is associated with any given order.

Let's say that I initiate a $1000 order for $VTSAX at 1 pm, before the bell closes. The price of $VTSAX at the end of the day is $100, and my order is filled, meaning I receive 10 shares of $VTSAX upon execution and see that the next time my account is updated after all transactions are settled. Nothing fancy, and easy to understand.

Now let's say that I place an order for $VTSAX at 10 pm, after the price has been set at $100. Will I immediately have my order executed and receive 10 shares? Or, because the market has already closed, will my order be queued up and executed the next time that $VTSAX's price gets set, aka the end of the next trading day? Let's say that in this scenario, I initiate the same $1000 order at 10 pm, the closing price for the current day is $100, and the closing price for the next day is $200: **how many shares will I have when my $1000 order executes?**

What if I make that same $1000 order at 12:00:01 am the next day?"

2019-04-15,waltwhitman83,6,"If you race to save $100k in mutual funds by 30, can you stop investing?","According to https://www.daveramsey.com/smartvestor/investment-calculator, if you are 30 retiring at 67 with $100k expecting a 10% return, you'll retire with $3.4m.

That probably isn't super realistic because as you age, you wouldn't be in something that 100% tracks the ""volatile"" market, but probably something more along the lines of a diversified portfolio with bonds. That would most likely drop the overly simplistic annual return rate of 10%.

However, it's also super unrealistic that from 30-67, you'll never contribute another dollar to your savings/retirement again.

How unrealistic is it to race to $100k by 30? I think I've read that the average American is probably woefully behind that, but I think across home equity/etc. the average American is probably pretty close to $50k-$75k net worth (excluding 30 year mortgage debt).

How unrealistic are 10% YoY returns? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S%26P_500_Index#Annual_returns quotes 10.53% from 1970 - 2018. I don't know if I'm incorrectly not adjusting for inflation."
2019-05-12,waltwhitman83,19,The age old question of real estate investing versus mutual funds for the average Joe,"I had an interesting conversation with somebody this weekend. They seemed to believe that:

1. mutual funds are extremely risky and you can lose all of your money because ""stocks are risky""

1. the bank would continue to give them lots of money to leverage yourself, as long as you put $10k-$20k down, get tenants, then prove the mortgage is covered via the tenants rent

1. he'd have access to ""wholesale real estate opportunities"". I felt this was tough because... the real estate market is like any market. There are people who do this full time with access to immense capital + connections. How would you average $40k-$60k/yr American citizen who has very little capital have any kind of upperhand or competitive edge against the real estate big boys?

1. eventually, he would have banking + CPA connections that would help him access all kinds of tax loopholes once he was at 2, 3, and 4+ rental properties. I personally didn't understand this logic because outside of: mortgage interest, property taxes, and repair / maintenance expenses (depending on how risky and fraudulent you want to get to the IRS...), what magic loopholes open up once you decide ""I'm an average citizen who wants to do rental properties""? or even ""I am an average citizen who has leverage properties, where's my tax loophole?""

I couldn't find the exact math to back it up but... after real estate appreciation (minus inflation), with very little vacancy / squatter / tenant issues, coupled with mortgage interest, paired with tax deductions, what is the average ROI for your typical middle class American trying to ""become a millionaire"" through either residential or commercial real estate / rental properties? Isn't it somewhere like 11-14%?

We all know the US market has historically yielded 10% with dividends reinvested, and about 7% after adjusted for inflation. I *think* I read that real estate works well because you leverage yourself by buying, say a $400k property with very little down, then get somebody else (tenants) to build equity for you. That yields a good ROI, I'm sure. However, there's obviously risk + headache involved. I do think that you are able to eek out an extra 3-4% compared to stock (somebody please let me know if it is much more than this, or in reality, less than this), but for more headache / potential risk (I get that stocks go down, but real estate property management is no walk in the park I'd imagine)

In my case, mortgage interest and property taxes wouldn't be greater than the standard deduction. Granted, that's for one property, not 4. I just don't know how I'd get a bank to give me 4 loans for 4 rental properties on my 1 salary income. Nor would I want to have that much open debt, lol

If you make $40-60k/yr and save up $20k, the bank might give you a $250-300k loan at maximum. Now, say you use that money to buy a rental property and you can prove for 12 months that you've had rental income under a contract, etc. When you go back to the bank for a second time (say with another $20k), do they give you *another* $250k-$300k loan? If not that amount, how much? Or do they not allow you to leverage like that?"

2019-07-27,CautiousInvestor,0,ETFs are strictly superior to their equivalent mutual funds.,"ETFs seem to have a whole bunch of advantages over mutual funds, with virtually no disadvantages. Granted, these advantages aren't huge, but since they are all stacked on the ETF side, it means you should **always choose the ETF** when both ETF and mutual fund vehicles are available for any investment.

Here are the advantages:

**Portability:**
You can always transfer an ETF between brokers. Not so with mutual funds. Brokers offer certain funds exclusively for their clients. Transferring those means you have to sell. That's a taxable 
event.

**Expense Ratio:**
At least on Vanguard (my main broker), ETFs are always a few basis points cheaper than their equivalent mutuals. Often you have to make a large initial investment, or you'll get an even worse ER. With ETFs, you can buy a single share and the ER will still be better than the best mutual that requires a large initial investment (aka Admiral Shares at Vanguard).

Here's a little comparison of ER (in basis points):

    Symbol | ETF ER | mutual ER
    ===========================
    VTI    |   3    |   4
    VXUS   |   9    |   11
    BND    |   3.5  |   5
    VT     |   9    |   10
    VSS    |   12   |   16

These differences are quite large, percentage-wise, with key funds like VTI being **33%** more expensive in their mutual fund form.

Also, these are all comparisons to the best class of mutual fund shares Vanguard offers (Admiral Shares). The gap versus regular shares is wider by a couple more basis points.

**Taxation:**
A complicated topic, and I don't pretend to understand it, but the bottom line is that [according](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/090215/comparing-etfs-vs-mutual-funds-tax-efficiency.asp) to [all](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/etf/etfs-tax-efficiency) reliable [sources](https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/etf-vs-mutual-fund-it-depends-on-your-strategy) I could find, ETFs are more tax efficient than mutual funds.

That's very important to a long-term buy-and-holder who is already at a high tax bracket due to regular income.

* * * * *

**Summary**

With several advantages and no known disadvantages to buying ETFs versus mutual funds, it seems the only reason to ever buy a mutual fund is when no appropriate ETF alternative exists. When such alternative does exist, it should be the preferred investment vehicle."

Yeah, my bad if I didn’t make this clear, but I mean buying ETFs specifically through M1 Finance though.

This means I can buy fractional shares, which eliminates the disadvantage of potentially having some cash “leftover”.

It also eliminates the advantage of being able to buy intraday, as all trades are done during a specific trading window.

I'm a fledgling investor looking to build my portfolio and have been looking into purchasing some shares of index funds. In my research, I have found that there is a way for mutual funds to be exchanged so that they don't count as shares being ""sold"" and thus generate realized gains subject to capital gains taxes.

My question is if ETFs can be exchanged in the same way, or if they will always have to be sold before the funds can be used to purchase different ETFs simply because they are purchased and sold like other stocks?  If this is not possible or advisable, what kind of tactics would there be to rebalance a portfolio?  I've been trying to research this question, but I might not be using the correct terms.

2019-04-25,Roboculon,5,An argument for buying stocks rather than mutual funds/etfs,"This is not about saving on management fees, it’s about tax loss harvesting. 

I never get to do it because all my funds and etfs are super diverse, and the market has been up the last few years, so none of my funds are down overall. But if I had a variety of individual stocks instead (even the same stocks I already have in mutual funds), I’d have the ability to sell them and realize the losses for tax benefits. 

In mutual funds there are individual holdings that go down, but they offer no tax benefit whatsoever, so the losses are effectively worse than they need to be. Using a loss to offset income is a huge effective reduction in the amount of net loss, and holding more individual stocks increases the odds you’ll get to do this.

Am I missing anything?"

2019-06-24,Thai_T,0,"""Best"" method for investing into Index/Mutual Funds?","Hi all,  


I'm new to investing, and have read up a bit on index/mutual funds. A few people I know suggests to invest as much money as I can afford into mutual funds. Before I start dumping my money into them, I wanted to be certain on how exactly you make a profit, and the best way to go about doing so.   


With my basic knowledge on this subject, can anyone elaborate on how you actually make a profit aside from dividends?Would you recommend saving up money and buying x of shares all at once, or set up automated monthly payments and trickle buy a few share each month?  


I've read that having money in the market is always better, but for example: if you go the trickle method, and you bought 100 share at 1$. The stock goes up to 2$ per share. You made a 100$ gain, and it continues to stay at 2$. Now you're still buying more shares every month, 2$ each. Your average cost per share will slowly increase, which means you'll have a smaller profit margin each month. If every month you continue to buy at all time high, you'll eventually start to even out. Assuming no dividend payouts in this scenario, you won't actually be making a profit at all in the long run. So you actually would NEED the price to drop in order to profit?  


So in this scenario, time in the market isn't always better than holding off and buying when it's lower? Am I looking at this the wrong way? Thank you for any advice you can give."

I'm yet to start investing, but I have concluded that I should start with REITs or Mutual Funds. Maybe both.

The types of REITs that I'd look into are unique ones like WY. I've seen O mentioned so many times, so I'd look into it as well. As for retail REITs I'd rather not look into them because I personally think that retailers will not perform well over the next few years.

The reason I'm thinking of mutual funds is because it gives me a lot of stress to research individual stocks. To my limited knowledge I know that mutual funds are a pool of individual stocks and that you're able to buy/sell these funds as individual shares. What I don't understand about mutual funds is:

1. How does their prices go up/down? Does the fund manager buy/sell individual shares in the fund to maintain a healthy price on the market?

2. Perhaps not every mutual fund pays out dividends, but what would be the advantage of a fund that doesn't pay out dividends?

3. I'm assuming that there's specifc mutual funds,just like REITs. For example, a mutual fund that only holds tech shares, or industrial shares. Correct?

I have under $1000 to spend on starting my portfolio. I'm aware that mutual funds gives me more diversification, and that REITs are obligated to give 90% back to its shareholders. With my limited budget to start with, I will say that individual stocks won't be helpful for me at the moment.

I've been trying to figure this out for a while but can't find too much regarding my question. We all know ETFs are more tax efficient than mutual funds, but is there a calculator to calculate the total costs of an ETF vs. a Mutual Fund? 

FZROX is a fidelity total market fund with a 0% expense ratio and no transaction fees, but has capital gains. ITOT is an ishare's total market fund that has no transaction fee but a .03% expense ratio. 

My math so far is that in a $10,000 investment, ITOT will have a fee of $3, but no capital gains. FZROX has had two capital gain distributions so far that amounted to $0.001 per share, the number of ""shares"" 10,000 would have is ~1,017, meaning the cap gains distribution is $1.01, 15% of that (long-term cap gains) is ~$0.15. That makes it seem like that with all costs included, FZROX is cheaper.

Is this the proper way to calculate this? Am I missing something? If it matters this is for a non-retirement account investment.

Since I have some extra cash on hand, I’m looking to “buy the dip” since  I’m 25+ years out from retirement. Im maxing my TSP (401K equivalent), maxed Roth IRA on January 1st (ouch!), and I just made a vanguard brokerage account to start buying mutual funds mimicking the S&P 500.  Whether this corona virus/oil dip lasts another month, or another six months, or a year, I’m in a position where I can put a little more in stocks than normal (yes, I am keeping a healthy emergency fund). 

Since it’s impossible to predict the dips with this volatility and no one knows where rock bottom will be, I’m thinking about dollar cost averaging the entirety of the corona virus. Would it be completely Idiotic to set my Vanguard brokerage account to something like $50 per day for the next few months (or whenever this craziness recovers), or do you recommend something else? Again, I’m only doing this because I have the extra cash And I’m 25+ years out from retirement. Sorry for the dumb questions, I’m new at this and trying to learn as much as possible. At the same time I realize this is an abnormal time to be investing and I don’t want to miss out. Thanks!"
2020-03-05,bano25,2465,PSA to anyone thinking of moving their brokerage accounts out of Robinhood: you do NOT need to liquidate all of your assets before transferring your positions out. Selling your positions triggers a taxable event and creates a capital gains tax liability. Simply submit an ACATS transfer.,"All you need to do is initiate an ACATS transfer at your preferred receiving brokerage and your assets will transfer over in-kind, meaning that your stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc will transfer and cost basis for tax purposes will transfer over as well. 

All of the major brokers such as TD, Fidelity, Schwab, E*Trade, etc support ACAT transfers. 

Note: proprietary or non-transferable positions may still need to be liquidated, but all publicly traded instruments should be fine.  These transfers typically take 5 business days and you should refrain from transacting on the account when you are ready to transfer. Don’t have open limit orders, expiring options, recurring ACHs open otherwise RH will reject your request. 

Godspeed!!

Edit: I am not a tax advisor so nothing I say should be construed as tax advice, so I cannot tell you what you should or should not do.  Please consult a tax professional if you have specific questions.

Edit #2: Again, I am NOT offering advice to anyone. This post should not be interpreted as me telling you to transfer your account. That decision is fully YOURS to make. 

Edit #3: I kind of touched on this, but an ACATS transfer will lock your account for the duration of the transfer, preventing you from trading. You need to be ok with not trading for ~5 business days (this can take longer depending on how long it takes the broker to review) so be cognizant of that given the market’s recent volatility."
2020-01-25,helio987,115,Why I should terminate my financial adviser.,"I know a lot of you guys will say to handle my own portfolio, which I do for about 25% of it.  Years ago, I was failing big time, in over my head so I brought it to RBC to straighten out.  Some of the stocks I still have from my initial purchases like msft, intc, cn rail, which now I have done great on.  The other day I went to see him and his new team wants to reconfigure my entire profile, basically sell all my stocks and purchase a series of dynamic asset allocation funds.  They are companies similar to Berskshire.  I asked what about my current stocks, are they transferable in kind to these funds.  He said no, they would be sold.  I brought up the fact that between a group of stocks that I own, I counted capital gain of 300k and with a few loser stocks that I lost about 40k.  So I have to pay tax on that now, which would put me in the highest tax bracket.  I could not believe he had no answer for that and did not even think about that.  I am not that smart but even I knew that.  He was proud that last year my portfolio did 15%, which is a mix of stocks, bonds, GIC.  Well on my own side, I did 15 % as well with some basic TD bank mutual funds, VTI and a few good stocks.  A lot of you guys on here are well versed in trading, I know enough to be dangerous and the dangerous part got me in trouble.  Face it, the last 8 years, anyone could have made money.  When I first started in the late 90's, it was like now.  I would buy 5k of stocks, in a few months, it was worth 7k, I would sell and go on vacation. Then the tech crash came  and i lost a ton. I am getting older, so you don't want to lose it all and that is what rbs is supposed to do but to sell all my stuff and hand me a huge capital gain bill was insane."
2020-03-21,e3b5,121,Want a little input investing $10k I can afford to lose.," Here's the deal:

Worked at a warehouse (Amazon) for a little over 3 years.

Managed to save over $50k so far.

I've been wanting to invest for some time, and given the way the market is looking due to the pandemic (COVID-19), I feel now is a better time than any to get started.

My job has given me a couple of free stock that's being ""managed/held"" by Morgan Stanley. I plan on keeping these long term.

I've been doing some research on where's best to invest (i.e. ETFs, Index funds, Options, mutual funds, etc.).

My plan right now is to take $10k that I have in cold hard cash (I don't keep my money in a bank - this might not be the best thing) and put it in the bank (Chase). I know Chase has a You Invest Now option for investing but I don't know if I'll use it.

I then plan on opening a brokerage account first with Fidelity because I feel it's a great all-around broker for beginners. I've read about TOS, IB, Schwab, and some of the others but I feel fidelity is a great start. If anyone has any reason why some of the others are better than Fidelity please tell me why.

I also want to get into trading options - not right away - so I thought about opening an account with tastyworks.

I'm looking to make both short-term (aggressive) and long-term (conservative) moves.

I really want to take advantage of the market right now, and I feel I can stand to risk/lose about 5-10k.

2020-03-22,ryeander,252,"WSJ: The Worst of the Global Selloff Isn’t Here Yet, Banks and Investors Warn","https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worst-of-the-global-selloff-isnt-here-yet-banks-and-investors-warn-11584877018?mod=mhp


The most brutal stretch for global markets since the financial crisis likely isn’t over yet, say investors and analysts who believe it is too early to assess the possible scale of economic damage from the coronavirus.

In just a few weeks, U.S. stocks have lost roughly a third of their value. In recent weeks, investors have even fled assets like U.S. government bonds and gold that typically do well during times of turmoil, underscoring the extent of the panic and the shock to once-robust investor sentiment delivered by the global health emergency.


But many analysts and portfolio managers warn that neither those declines nor recent extraordinary actions by the Federal Reserve are likely to signal the end of the market crunch. They note that by historical standards, stocks’ declines look modest compared with some prior downturns, given the early indications of how much damage virus-related shutdowns are likely to do to global growth. The S&P 500 is down 32% from its February peak. In comparison, stocks tumbled 57% during the financial crisis and 49% after the dot-com bubble burst in 2000 before beginning to rebound.


What’s more, some investors say, Wall Street is only now coming to grips with the dislocation being wrought by the virus. Analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said this past week they expect U.S. economic output to tumble 24% in the second quarter, one of the worst readings on record and potentially foretelling a U.S. recession even if growth picks back up in the second half of the year.

With everyday life grinding to a halt from New York to Milan, the world’s biggest money managers and banks say they believe one of the most prominent market casualties from this episode could be long-term investors’ ingrained inclination to step in to buy the dip. Before the coronavirus outbreak, investors’ faith in the strength of the U.S. economy had led them repeatedly to rush back into the market after pullbacks to scoop up discounted shares, a response that became so routine it came to be known by its own initials, BTD or, with more intensity, BTFD. Now, many believe it could be some time before that behavior returns.

“The ultimate impact of the virus on economies and markets is highly speculative at this time since there is so much we do not know about how the outbreak will actually evolve from here,’’ said Rick Lacaille, global chief investment officer of State Street Global Advisors. “We need clarity on many fronts.”


Investors will get more of a sense of how badly the economy has been hit in the coming days when data on the manufacturing and services sectors and jobless claims are released.

The latter data point has already spiked—leading Goldman to predict there could be an “unprecedented surge” in the number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits over the next week.


The firm forecasts the S&P 500 could be in for a 41% fall from peak to trough. Bank of America Corp. believes the selloff might not ease until the S&P 500 hits 1800—a 47% drop from its February record. And Credit Suisse Group AG , which notes stocks didn’t hit their trough during the SARS pandemic in 2003 until a week after the number of new infections peaked, estimates the S&P 500 could be in for a 35% drop overall.

If economic output shrinks by double-digit percentages in the second quarter, it would be a devastating pullback even by historical standards: Adjusted for inflation and seasonality, GDP fell less than 5 percentage points from peak to trough during the 2007-09 recession, which was the longest downturn since World War II.

To put a floor on the current market rout, some of the world’s biggest investors say they need three things: better information on the scale of the coronavirus pandemic, powerful support from governments and more forceful intervention in markets.


A key issue is the uncertainty surrounding what it will take to halt the fast-moving health crisis, and the economic fallout of such measures, investors say. Governments are using a range of strategies, from stringent lockdowns in Italy, France and Spain to looser recommendations of social distancing in the U.K. and much of the U.S. As the measures vary, so does the level of economic disruption.

Investors need “clarity on the ultimate scale of the problem and evidence that the infection’s curves are bending globally,” said Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute. Credible news on development of a vaccine and treatments would also help restore confidence, he said.


Central banks in some of the world’s biggest economies have taken steps to cut interest rates to bolster economic growth and are acting together to boost the dollar’s availability. Investors are looking for governments to also coordinate actions.

“One thing we’ve learned in the crisis in 2008 is that policy is a lot more than the sum of its parts if it’s done as a global response,” said Mr. Boivin.


So far, governments don’t seem to have deployed enough fiscal stimulus—especially in Europe, said Didier Borowski, head of macroeconomic research at Amundi. The relief and stimulus measures should probably be equivalent to 2% to 3% of the eurozone’s economic output, he said.

But others believe fiscal stimulus won’t do much to arrest the market selloff.


Cornerstone Macro analyzed the stock market’s response to bursts of fiscal stimulus during the 2001 and 2008 downturns and found the S&P 500 actually continued falling over a one-year period.

“Selloffs end when the problem that caused the selloff is under control,” said Michael Kantrowitz, chief investment strategist at the firm.

Another area of concern for investors: the fact that credit markets, encompassing both the safest sovereign bonds as well as more speculative corporate debt, have been in turmoil due to liquidity constraints, the pressure to unwind the riskiest trades and investors’ demand for cash.

Investors would like to see “more aggressive steps by policy makers to provide some stability in fixed-income markets,’’ said Evan Brown, head of multiasset strategy at UBS Asset Management. “This includes a Fed/Treasury partnership to provide lending against corporate bonds as collateral and the ECB aggressively stepping up purchases of Italian debt.”

The Fed said earlier this month that it would provide $1.5 trillion through short-term lending and spend $500 billion on Treasury securities to improve market functioning. On Wednesday, the Treasury Department approved a new lending facility from the Fed to act as a backstop for money-market mutual funds. While this move is welcomed, investors say that the market is still weighing its effectiveness.

“Market participants need to feel they are backstopped without question,’’ said State Street’s Mr. Lacaille. “Arguably this is what the Fed and Treasury Department have tried to signal and achieve, turning from messaging into action, but it seems there is a leap of faith needed by the market too.’’"

2020-03-05,wadenelsonredditor,165,Simple Bear Market Strategy for Small Investors,"Most small investors don't know how to make money in a bear market. Their stock strategy is ""buy and hold."" They ONLY buy stocks (and funds) they believe will INCREASE in ~~value.~~ price.

Right now they're madly buying Clorox, Netflix, Zoom, INST, Invio, stocks they expect to buck the market. and go UP.

**What are some investments you could make that will earn you money when you expect stock prices and the overall market to continue to go DOWN?**

Investments that go UP when the Dow or S&P goes DOWN include  A) Selling individual stocks short, B) buying PUT options  C) Bonds,  D) Certain ""Negative"" index funds,  E) Precious metals, or precious metal funds, mining companies, etc.   **In this article I'm going to try to convince you to go with ""D,"" Negative Index Funds.**

**A) What is ""Selling short?**"" You ""sell"" a stock at today's higher price --- agreeing to deliver it in 90 days or whatever -- expecting it to decline in price between now and then. You pocket the difference.

For example Apple.  With Chinese supply chain problems, Apple is LIKELY to decline in value in coming days.  It would be a good stock to consider shorting.  Along with WYNN - the casinos.

If you sell short, however, and the stock goes up, you still have to deliver it REGARDLESS of what it costs you to buy.  

**OK TO SKIP THIS NEXT PARAGRAPH!**

**What are put options?**  *A* ***put option*** *is a contract giving the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell, or sell short, a specified amount of an underlying security at a pre-determined price within a specified time frame. The pre-determined price the* ***put option*** *buyer can sell at is called the strike price*

Continue reading here:

Shorts are primarily for professional investors. You can lose more money than you started with, face margin calls (Send us more cash or lose your initial investment too!) Buying puts isn't too risky, but ""writing"" or selling them --- Danger Will Robinson!

Leave short-selling Apple and Amazon, and writing puts to big investors with deep pockets. *Always remember, the market can remain irrational longer than your wallet is deep!*

D) **Negative index funds** are one way for SMALL investors to take a position ""betting"" that the overall market will go down. You can POTENTIALLY only lose your initial investment, and not a penny more.

Let me tell you about a couple of index funds that GO UP when the S&P goes down.  Like SDS

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/etfs-mutual-funds/042716/3-best-etfs-short-sp-500-sh-sds.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/etfs-mutual-funds/042716/3-best-etfs-short-sp-500-sh-sds.asp)

Full disclosure: I own shares in [Proshares.com](https://Proshares.com)  ""SDS"" fund.

SDS portfolio consists of short positions on stocks, and put options on stocks and other derivatives.  (I don't know it's exact content, you can download a prospectus)

An index fund trades like a stock. You can only (potentially) lose your initial investment.   They buy the risky shorts, sell calls, derivatives, .... not you.

You buy ""SDS"" or a similar fund at a lower price and hope it goes up. AS IF it were a stock. My personal investment in the SDS fund has gone from $25/share to $29 a share as the market has crashed.

Chart: [https://imgur.com/gallery/mV6hC09](https://imgur.com/gallery/mV6hC09)

When the S&P goes down, ""SDS"" goes up. Likewise if the S&P goes up, ""SDS"" will go down. FAST. It's leveraged, approximately 2:1. You win big or lose big.

2:1 not enough leverage for you?  They have one that's 3:1.  Make money fast or lose it fast.

A lot of brokers consider funds like SDS strictly short-term investments.  Personally I believe the market is going to be headed down for a long time so I'm disregarding their advice.  In the comments below you can get some idea WHY they feel the way they do - issues like ""slippage"" which is the gradual loss of principle.   

**An investment in SDS or similar should only make up on a part of a BALANCED portfolio.** In a bear market that might also bonds, physical gold or a GOLD index fund, cash, plus any biostocks, vaccine companies, web conferencing stocks (ZM, INST)  you think might buck the market.  Netflix & Clorox, lol!

Are index funds without their own problems?  Of course not!

Honestly I did not FULLY understand all of these problems when I originally wrote this article, but if you read through the comments, another Redditor has done a GREAT job of clarifying such things as ""beta decay.""  Market swings --- yo-yo'ing --- may also eat into the value of your investment, and we're certainly seeing a lot of those!

(A truly professional investor might use a ""straddle"" strategy to make money on violent market swings.  This is beyond MY pay grade...) 

*You can (and should) download a prospectus on any investment you intend to make and AT LEAST* ***try*** *and read and understand it.*

[https://www.proshares.com/funds/prospectus.html?ticker=SDS](https://www.proshares.com/funds/prospectus.html?ticker=SDS)

*FWIW, SDS is one of SEVERAL funds offered by Proshares that tracks inversely with different markets Their funds offer differing amounts of ""leverage,"" the market they track, etc.*

I was at one time a licensed broker. I am not now. Use your own judgement.  **Don't do anything just because a stranger on the internet tells you to, ok**? I am simply trying to inform casual investors that there IS a way to earn money in a declining market BESIDES ""risky""short selling.

**Most important:**  Do not ever make ANY investments you do not personally understand!!!  Keep reading and researching until you are COMFORTABLE with any investment ""vehicle"" you intend to buy or sell. Or find a broker you trust.  (lol...)

**About brokers:**  If they know so dang much, why don't they invest their own money and get rich instead of dialing the phone all day begging YOU to let them manage YOUR money.  Being a broker is a job, nothing more.  They live on commissions by convincing you to buy and sell often.  Their best interests and yours MAY OR MAY NOT OVERLAP.

*Of course it's all peaches and creams when the market goes up for 11 straight years.  Now is the time when it gets sticky...*

*There's gonna be a lot of bad news in the coming days, due to the pandemic.*  I personally can watch the market headed down knowing its decline is putting a few extra bucks into my account. *Hopefully I'll be alive to spend it*.

**TL;DR:** An investment in a specialized ""negative"" index fund like SDS can make you money when stock prices go down (S&P index.)  It's ""safer"" than shorting stocks or options trading, the traditional methods of making money in a bear market.  Leave those to the pros!"
2020-02-26,reddit_1999,1,how do they make money besides buy and sell commissions?,"Excuse the ELI5 type question, but how is Fidelity, Schwab, etc... making money on my retirement accounts when they no longer charge buy and sell commissions? I know there is an expense fee associated with ETF's , mutual funds. Is that it? TIA"
2020-03-26,std_enable_if,53,"Investing psychology: do people who make more money care less about getting the ""best"" returns?","I realized that when I was a college student, I was pretty obsessed with getting 50-100% returns a year, often taking on big risks to do so. I was trying to time the market, using leveraged ETFs and options, buying and selling VIX products, and buying high risk/high reward stocks.

After graduation, I got myself a pretty decent job, and I've been maxing my 401k into an S&P500 mutual fund regardless of market fluctuations without a care in the world. I'm also buying stocks that I like outside my 401k that I think have great future potential through DCA, without much regard to their price movements. I feel like I'm making so much as a 23 year old compared to my peers, that even if my investments underperform, I'll still be doing relatively well later in life, so returns matter less. Like, for example, if I have 0% returns for the next 40 years, I'll still probably be able to amass 5M by the time I'm 65 assuming I get no raises, which would be 2.3M inflation-adjusted at 2%. In a HYSA, it'd be 5M inflation-adjusted. That's definitely enough, and I have no care about getting more than that. I also don't have a target retirement age - more like if I have enough for 3% SWR and I don't care much about working anymore I'll retire.

I did a little poll with my other high-earning friends, and they share similar opinions, mostly just DCA away, but when we were in college, we would be thinking about shit like XIV, and how to short the VIX spike, etc.

What does r/investing think? Are the market timers mostly people who are earning less and think the stock market is a way to get ahead? I hypothesize that there's a correlation between earning more and taking less risk when investing, and probably why the really rich folks put some money away in hedge funds that return less than the market but with less volatility."

I'm looking at their basic stats such as costs, but lost on where to find documentations that details these specific terms. I sent a message to Vanguard representatives and received a seemingly detailed reply:

***

Our Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund is now offered in two share
classes: our conventional mutual fund Admiral share class (VTSAX) and our
exchange-traded fund (ETF) share class, which trades under the ticker
symbol VTI.

Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund had also been offered as an Investor
Share class, which had a higher expense ratio, or cost, than its Admiral
share counterpart, but had a lower initial investment minimum requirement.
However, the Investor share class of Total Stock Market Index Fund has now
been eliminated.

The Admiral share class of our Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund was
previously available to investors with a $10,000 minimum investment. Now,
you only need $3,000 to purchase into the lower-cost  Vanguard Total Stock
Market Index Fund Admiral Shares.

Vanguard ETFs, including VTI, have an initial minimum investment of the
price of one share.

MUTUAL FUNDS AND ETFS>>
Both the conventional mutual fund and the ETF share classes of Vanguard
Total Stock Market Index Fund invest in the exact same companies.

Vanguard ETFs invest in domestic, international, and sector-specific stock
and bond index funds, and cover a range of market segments, investment
styles, sectors, and industries. The investment objective and policies for
each Vanguard ETF are the same as corresponding mutual fund share classes,
with one exception: ETF shares trade continuously on the stock exchange,
and at market prices rather than net asset value.

Continuous trading allows you to buy and sell ETF shares throughout the
day. Mutual funds, in contrast, are priced once daily after the market
closes.

ETFs may trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value. The
market price of an ETF is determined by the prices of the stocks and bonds
held by the ETF as well as market supply and demand.

ETFs and conventional mutual funds have expense ratios--annual operating
expenses--expressed as a percentage of assets. Expense ratios for most ETFs
are lower than those for conventional mutual fund shares. This is because
ETFs do not have recordkeeping expenses that conventional mutual funds
have.

At Vanguard, you'll see this difference if you compare the conventional
mutual fund with its corresponding ETF. For example: as of April 26, 2019,
the expense ratio for VTSAX was 0.04%. On the other hand, the expense ratio
for VTI was 0.03% as of April 26, 2019.

**Vanguard ETF shares are not redeemable with the issuing fund other than
in very large aggregations worth millions of dollars. Instead, investors
must buy and sell Vanguard ETF shares in the secondary market and hold
those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur
brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and
receive less than net asset value when selling.**

- investing in value/momentum micro cap stocks.  Large funds often can't buy/sell microcaps, so there could be more opportunities for retail investors

- Trend following since retail investors can get in and out of positions very easily and sometimes for free."

TDLR: what are the general risks of ETFs / Mutual Funds / Index Investing?

12 months ago I read a book on money, then another and another and another and another and well you get the point. I’m now working hard towards FIRE like the rest of you. 

My best friends know about my investments and have asked me to run a short presentation on investing, my strategy and how I plan to be able to retire at 35. This isn’t a formal thing, it’s a few of my best mates in a shed with a few beers chatting about fire. They don’t know much about investing so I plan to walk them through everything from, what is the stock market? to dividend reinvestment plans. I’m pretty excited.

As much as I love ETFs, i want to present a balanced argument, and help them understand the risks associated. 

I’ve tried to do some research but none of the negatives, like tracking errors, seem like big deals to me in a long term strategy. 

TLDR: Help me introduce some friends to fire by highlighting the negatives/risks to long term investing in ETFs?"
2020-01-16,I_m_Not_a_Bot_a_Lot,154,"If ""it's already priced in"", how does anyone make money? (Beginner)","Unless you know something other investors don't - insider trading, or you just negotiated an international trade deal and it has not yet been reported to the public - how is it possible to make money in the stock market, besides luck?

I know there are strategies like ""dollar cost averaging"" and diversification in terms of geography as well as industry, and I know in theory ""stocks only go up"" (in the long run, on average), but still....

If all the factors that might make you think a stock will increase or decrease have already been factored into the current price, how is it possible to make money by owning stock?

If a company has consistently growing profits for 4 quarters in a row, it could still have a lower price than it did at the start of the year, if the profits haven't been as high as expected.

There are many technologies that I believe will become widely adopted in the next decade, but surely many other investors see that promise too (example: gene therapy), so stock prices already reflect expected future earnings, yes?

If, instead of choosing stocks, I just invest in index funds or mutual funds or ETFs, does that really change the question?  I'm still buying a set of stocks at their current prices, which reflect expected future earnings, yes?

\[Edit:  If I'm going to try to know more than hundreds/thousands of investment analysis teams, sounds like I'm going to be doing a ton of work, with fairly equal probabilities of gains or losses.  Not just me, a beginner, but it sounds like people who have been doing this for decades must be spending a ton of time with fairly equal probabilities of gains or losses - only leaning towards gains because ""stocks only go up"" (on average, in a well-diversified portfolio, if the world doesn't totally go to hell).  I can imagine people earn below minimum wage - unless they have hundreds of thousands in the market, so a 6% return amounts to moderately decent compensation for their time.\]

I googled, perhaps not using the best search terms.  I did not find anything that addressed my question directly."
2020-01-06,Selenography,11,Thoughts on Vanguard LifeStrategy balances funds?,"I came across Vanguard’s LifeStrategy funds (Conservative (VSCGX), Growth (VASGX), Moderate Growth (VSMGX)) and they look interesting. They each split their balance between stocks (US and international) and bonds (US and international). They seem like a pretty decent ‘one stop shop’ for total diversification, but I never see them discussed here. 

The reason I’m looking into them is: my wife and I are maxing out our tax-advantaged accounts, we are putting money in HYSAs for nearer term goals, and I want to start contributing more to our taxable brokerage. I already have ETFs like VOO, VOOG, VTI, but I want to buy into a mutual fund so that I can DCA easier and I wouldn’t have to worry about buying whole shares of ETFs. 

Are things like these LifeStrategy funds (ER: ~0.14%) a good bet? Or is keeping it more basic with a regular Balanced fund (VBIAX, ER: 0.07%) or S&P index (VFIAX, ER: 0.04%) a better long term strategy?"

2020-03-13,flatchampagne,14,Active funds have the edge on passives in week of turmoil,"[https://www.ft.com/content/d3dcd0dd-1982-4870-9803-3c2efaa23dc1](https://www.ft.com/content/d3dcd0dd-1982-4870-9803-3c2efaa23dc1)

*Article by Madison Darbyshire for the* ***Financial Times****, it is behind a paywall so here you go:*

Active managers in the UK are outperforming passive equity funds in the market sell-off, boosting longstanding claims that the former prove their mettle at times of volatility.

 “For active managers it is showtime,” said Anthony Morrow, chief executive of OpenMoney, a financial advice service. “For many years they claimed . . . that they would be judged by what happens in a downturn, sharp or not.” 

Since February 20, four out of five UK mutual funds invested in US equities outperformed the market, while 89 per cent of active UK funds outperformed. In European equities, 91 per cent of active funds beat market declines, according to analysis from fund research firm FE Fund Info.  

“Active managers did a very good job in protecting from the downside, as they avoided the most cyclical part of the markets such as energy and banks,” said Charles Younes, research manager of FE Fund Info. However, he added that active managers in Japanese and emerging markets had suffered. 

While active funds have done better relative to passives, they have still suffered heavy losses. In the year to date, the average fund in the UK All Companies sector — which includes tracker funds, but is mostly comprised of active funds — is down by 25.2 per cent on a total-return basis, compared with a 29.2 per cent decline in the index, according to Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Investment Management. 

“The best-performing funds have been those with higher exposure to smaller companies and mid-caps, as large caps have been worst hit. ESG funds have strongly outperformed, due to lack of exposure to oil and gas and typically low exposure to other commodity stocks,” he said.  Passive funds in the UK gilt market performed on par with active gilt funds over the same period, according to the data, closing the performance gap between active and passive over the year. Until the recent sell-off, only one active fund had managed to beat the benchmark.

 But actives did not outdo passives across the board. Actively managed strategic bond funds, which were down 2.9 percentage points on average, outperformed investment-grade passive bond funds, which fell 3.1 per cent, but fell short of the global bond market, which remained flat. 

Active bond funds could have performed better had they taken quick action to move into government bonds. Mr Younes said: “You could have expected them to return more, something in line with the total bond market.” 

Active managers insist they prove their worth at times of market turmoil. “It would be glib to say our active managers are rubbing their hands together with glee,” said Chris Ralph, chief global strategist at wealth manager St James’s Place, noting that drops in equity prices allow managers to pick up attractive companies for a discount. 

Mr Ralph said St James’s Place, which invests client money in its own funds, had been “outperforming the index benchmarks we have set”.  Some fund managers cautioned against declaring victory for active over passive. “Our experience is that over longer-term periods you tend to find that most active managers underperform the passive options once fees have been taken into account,” said Iain Barnes, head of portfolio management at wealth manager NetWealth. 

New data show that investors pulled more than £377m out of UK active equity funds in the first nine days of March, with £239m in outflows occurring on Monday. More than £318m was moved into passive funds, which have seen inflows every day since the beginning of March, according to data from Calastone, a funds transaction network. 

Edward Glyn, head of global markets at Calastone, said: “With markets showing such extreme volatility, trying to time entry points is a very risky strategy. Those that bought last week may already be nursing burnt fingers after the market continued to decline.”   Index trackers were hard hit in the past week because of exposure to oil and gas, which have tumbled as a result of the oil price war that erupted over the weekend.

But the 48 per cent slide in oil and gas capital returns has benefited those who chose to invest in ethical or green funds, said Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Investment Management.

He said: “Funds with exposure to mid-caps and ESG funds have done well for not having energy or commodity exposure.”  On Thursday, the FTSE 100 saw its second-biggest sell-off on record, and the S&P closed 6 per cent down, though markets recovered some of their losses in early trading on Friday. US Treasury bond yields rose this week as the market slid, and gold futures also fell. Analysts say the market has now entered bear territory after a record bull run. 

Investors received formal notification from their discretionary wealth managers on Wednesday warning them that their portfolios had lost more than 10 per cent of their value in the first quarter, a requirement under Mifid II regulatory reforms. 

“The requirement to tell clients within 24 hours that a significant loss has occurred encourages short-term thinking, and risks people making changes to their portfolio at what is almost certainly the worst possible time to do so,” said Mr Morrow, who noted an increase in appointments with advisers since the sell-off began.  

“The bigger concern is what do customers receiving these who have no adviser do and who do they turn to?” said Mr Morrow, who cautioned that letters to customers of non-advisory platforms risk increasing investor panic and fuelling a sell-off.

“Encouraging instant reactions to market volatility is dangerous and risks exactly the sort of poor outcomes that the regulator is normally working to avoid.”  Discretionary managers say it is more important than ever to communicate with clients to prepare them to receive such letters, which will go out again if a portfolio loses an additional 10 per cent, and explain what the losses mean given their target risk exposure. 

Advisers insisted that regardless of active or passive management, the best investment strategy in a crisis is a long-term one. Vanguard, which holds about $1.3tn or 25 per cent of its assets under management in active funds, reported a doubling in the number of US clients making trades on the platform.

At 3.8 per cent of clients, however, the level is still relatively low.   “Many Vanguard investors have seen the global financial crisis, they’ve seen the tech bubble, they know to stay the course,” said Jean Young, Vanguard senior research associate.  

Pointing to a study of investment activity among those holding US retirement plans in the years following the financial crisis, she said: “The most frequent traders actually had lower returns than people who didn’t trade at all.”"

2020-02-02,unreliabletags,0,Brokerage tech tradeoffs,"Assumptions: you buy index mutual funds or ETFs. You invest via payroll deduction and want it to be as automatic as possible. You use a password manager and want real 2FA, [not SMS](https://www.issms2fasecure.com/). After setting up the mobile app, you expect not to do 2FA or password manager business again, just Touch ID or PIN. You don't do much active trading, or you use a separate brokerage for that e.g. Robinhood.

**Vanguard**

* Reasonable if dated UI.
* Supports Fido U2F (Yubikey) 2FA on the website.
* Supports Touch ID on the mobile app, even with U2F enabled.
* Really nice visualization of overall return.
* Free trades on mutual funds, can invest 100% without worrying about divisibility by share price.
* Couldn't automatically invest direct deposit into mutual funds, had to set up a separate automatic investment, which broke when there was slight variation in payday for weekends and holidays, so ended up always putting in my biweekly buy orders manually.
* Mobile app wants a password even after Touch ID to make trades or really get anywhere past the home screen.

**Fidelity**

* Reasonable, more sophisticated but also dated UI.
* Supports Symantec VIP (TOTP like Google Authenticator or Authy) on web and mobile.
* Unified view with employer 401k.
* Free trades on more things, but only ETFs not Vanguard funds. Leaves a couple hundred dollars of uninvested cash sometimes.
* Can't automatically invest into an ETF at all. Theoretically supports automatic investment into mutual funds but the trades have steep fees.
* Poor visibility into total return over time, data is there but you have to build the visualization yourself.
* Mobile app supports Touch ID but also wants a VIP code every session. My phone is already the second factor! Don't make me switch apps.

**Chase You Invest**

* Unified view with checking and credit card.
* Can use the balance to qualify for premium Chase service tiers (Sapphire, Private Client, etc).
* Chase app supports touch ID and only asks for more authentication when reasonable (new outgoing transfer account, etc).
* No 2FA available other than SMS.
* Godawful UX, designed by a committee of children, can barely figure out how to do the most basic things.

**Robinhood**

* Beautiful design. Thoughtful, joyful UX. 
* Supports TOTP for initial login and Touch ID for ongoing sessions, like a sane tech company.
* Feels like a toy / meme and not the right place for six-figure life savings unless you're planning to YOLO it all on options trades. This company literally announced a checking account and retracted it that afternoon when it learned that banking is a regulated industry.

**Betterment / Wealthfront**

* Haven't tried, but 25bps seems like a lot to pay for a less annoying UI.

What are your experiences with other brokerages? Have you found the holy grail?"
2020-02-04,DogsFuckingSuck,40,Do people actually see investing this way?,"I’m in a behavioral economics/decision theory class in college. We were talking today about how people tend to be risk-averse when looking at potential gains (“I want a sure thing”) and risk-prone when facing losses (“I’ll take a risk because I *really* don’t want to lose money”). My professor brings up the stock market and explains how this phenomenon tends to make a lot of people sell winners too early because they want to cash in on their earnings and hold on to losers for too long because of the prospect of getting their money back. All of this makes sense, right?

Then she asks if any of us have an example. I told her I invested about $25k of my college fund in FB at $25/share and sold at $75/share, making me about $50k. She said that that was a “bad decision” because FB is worth over $200 now.

I can’t seriously believe that some people view investing like that. Are we just supposed to hold our stocks until the day before a cliff and then magically sell them before their value plummets? Is selling once you’ve made a fair amount of profit an undesirable outcome? I sold my shares because 1) I didn’t want to lose that much from my college fund and 2) I began to lose sight of what Facebook was attempting to accomplish as a company. I don’t think it’s good just to have your money sitting in a company hoping it’s going to appreciate in value. You should follow your companies more closely and pull out when you feel the future is getting uncertain or grim. That’s why I mostly keep my money in mutual funds nowadays - I’m not so keen on following the market that closely anymore and I don’t want to be guessing blindly."

With ETFs we just trade the units on the exchange like stocks. But what is the function of the ETF manager in this process?

What if one wants to buy an ETF but there are no seller, will ETF manger act as a seller as long as the order is placed within unit's NAV?

Same question for the case when one wants to sell an ETF at NAV and there are no buyers, will ETF manager act as a manager?

I was trying to find the answer in ETF prospectuses but without much luck...

Example:  ETF with NAV=$10 Ask Size=0. One places limit buy at $10.5 for 1,000 ETF units. 

Will ETF manager act as a seller since the Ask Size is at zero? Do they have to? What are the rules?

I feel like any kind of financial emergency or unexpected bill can wait 2-3 days while I sell some shares, settle it up, and move the money over to somewhere I can write a check. It's certainly not cash in hand, but almost just as good, barring any crashes. Just looking over my performance for the year, ETFs look to be more stable than my various stocks. Both have their ups and downs, but the stocks look to be up and down day to day, while the ETFs move in slower waves. Am I missing something?

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shops, restaurants and cinemas may be deserted in many parts of virus-plagued China, but online trading forums, internet roadshows and analyst calls are teeming with investors who have driven up stock trading volumes to nine-month highs.


Strategists are busy meeting anxious investors online to dispense tips on how to trade the coronavirus, while fund managers aggressively pitch products via live video streaming, with face-to-face conferences banned and many offices still closed.

The virus has been a blow to China’s already-slowing economy, prompting Beijing to boost financial support to avoid a deeper hit to economic growth. But with many cities still locked down and people staying home amid efforts to contain an epidemic that has killed more than 1,000, online activity is buzzing.

“The government is injecting liquidity to aid the virus-hit economy,” said Shanghai-based hedge fund manager Li Zhen, who has been trading at home since the outbreak began around the start of the Lunar New Year in late January.

“Loose liquidity, plus a rising willingness to trade, help lift trading turnover.”

Investor enthusiasm is highlighting a long-standing disconnect between China’s stock market and its real economy.

While analysts and government researchers forecast a sharp hit to the country's GDP growth this year, Chinese equities have risen for six consecutive sessions as investors piled in to hunt for bargains following the market's .SSEC 8% plummet on Feb. 3, the first trading session after the new year.

The start-up board ChiNext .CNT has recovered all its losses, hitting a more than three-year-high on Monday, while the Shanghai market last week witnessed its biggest weekly trading volume since April, 2019.

“Investors who missed last year’s bull run are taking advantage of the correction to get onto the ride,” said Huang Wei, a former Wall Street trader who has recently set up a trading forum on China’s WeChat messaging platform that offers paid stock recommendation services to retail investors.

“The virus doesn’t change long-term fundamentals of China’s market, just as the Pearl Harbor incident didn’t change U.S. economic strength,” he said, adding Beijing will likely deliver more stimulus, including rate cuts, to cushion the economic fallout from the virus outbreak.

Membership in Huang's newly established trading forum has grown to more than 100 in just a few days as investors are lured into a market that saw the blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 jump 36% last year.

That trading enthusiasm has spurred local brokerage Huatai Securities into launching a series of conference calls to help investors pick stocks. Companies to be discussed this week include Anhui Honglu Steel Construction (Group) Co (002541.SZ) and China Railway Group (601390.SS).

Robin Lu, an entrepreneur, said making money through stock investing is more promising than doing business under the current environment.

“The real economy is struggling. But in the stock market, there’s a structural bull,” said Lu, who favors technology stocks. His consultancy business has been affected by the virus, which hit many of his clients.

Meanwhile, mutual fund managers are promoting products for investors who don’t want to pick stocks themselves. More than 30 new funds have been launched over the past week, with several snapped up by investors in just a few days.

China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC) launched a week-long online roadshow in which 11 fund managers take turns to introduce fund products and share investment views via live video streaming.

“The impact from the virus is short term and won’t affect long-term investment,” ChinaAMC fund manager Zhou Keping told a live forum on Monday, advising investors to buy into tech-focused funds.

The stock market will benefit from “relatively loose liquidity conditions that will improve risk appetite,” he said."

What are some of your favorite funds and why? 

What are some funds on your watchlist? 

Most of my net worth is with Vanguard because they offer a vast selection of low cost funds that serve so many different strategies. I love that some of their funds hold equities and bonds in a single fund and automatically rebalance. 

Vanguard is owned by its Funds. The Funds are owned by the shareholders. Shareholders own Vanguard. No outside investors other than its shareholders.  

My current holdings: 

VBIAX - My core taxable fund that's 60% US equities and 40% US bonds in a single fund. 


VIGI - Tracks 400 international dividend growth companies, held in my taxable account. I opted for the ETF instead of the mutual fund equivalent, VIAAX, because the mutual fund charges purchase and redemption fees of 25 bps. 


VMFXX - Highest yielding Money Market fund I've found that costs 11 bps. Opted for VMFXX over VMMXX (Prime MMF) because in distressed situations, Vanguard can restrict liquidation of VMMXX (however this hasn't ever happened to my knowledge). All my cash savings are held in VMFXX. 2 of my checking accounts are directly linked to VMFXX. 


VASGX - LifeStrategy growth fund for my Roth IRA fund that's 80% global equities and 20% global bonds in a single fund. 



Watchlist: VBR/VSIAX (small-cap value), VGT (tech sector). 


Note: I already track the S&P 500 in my Fidelity 401k which is why I don't hold VFIAX (VOO)."

2020-03-11,DeathStarJedi,1,"Reallocate investments to bond funds during bear market, then swap back to standard 90%-stock/10%-bond allocation when market eventually turns back to a positive trend?","I've seen many people say not to reallocate and to ride the wave, but I did this in the '08 financial crisis and was able to actually make some money while the market was declining, then when it started to recover I reallocated and rode the wave back up. 

My crystal ball isn't perfect, and I'm not trying to time the market on a daily/weekly basis here, but what is wrong with reallocating based on major trends? Mass quarantines are increasing worldwide and that is going to mean a lot of people losing a lot of income. If that is going to have a general negative economic impact on the global markets, how would it be better to keep my funds mostly in equity based mutual funds right now as opposed to reallocating to bonds?"
2020-02-29,markmc137,10,Small powerful choices in life to share with teenagers or even adults.,"I love compound interest! My father taught me this concept when I was 12. I know the Stock market is taking a beating this week but here’s a great illustration:  Today a teenager (or even an adult) will buy a fancy cup of coffee for $5.  But let’s say they instead choose water and take that $5 and buy a mutual fund that represents 500 of the biggest companies (also known as the S&P 500). So they own one penny of Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Facebook, google, Coca-Cola, Walt Disney, etc. and are very diversified in their investments. For the last 108 years the S&P 500 has experience about a 10% return on investment. If they leave that five dollars alone and never invest again it will be worth $271.94 in 40 years.  If they drink water just on Mondays and take that $5 and do the same thing they will have about $141,000. If they invest $5 everyday and do the same thing they could be worth 1 million. Now nothing is guaranteed and it could all be worthless in the end but what if this 108 year period repeats a similar history? A little everyday compounded in the right investment can add up to HUGE gains."
2019-11-15,BestInterestDotBlog,6,Luck vs. Skill,"I've recently been reading a lot about the idea of luck vs. skill in the market. Thought I would share this bit, as unpopular as it might be :)     

Very open to hearing alternative thoughts.    

""A [recent MIT study](https://epubs.siam.org/doi/pdf/10.1137/16M1102094) looked at various games to see how much “skill” was actually involved. Coin flipping, one would think, would be 0% skill and 100% chance. While chess—a turn-based game where both players see all information at all times—would be 100% skill. The MIT scientists “reasoned that if a game were more skill-based, then a player’s performance should be persistent. It might be good or bad, but it would remain relatively constant over multiple rounds.”    

On a scale of zero (pure luck) to one (pure skill), coin flipping indeed ranked a zero. But moving back towards the stock market, the study also looked at **45,000 mutual funds’** performances from 2005 to 2015, and ended up giving mutual funds a score of **0.32**. Some skill, sure, but **mostly luck**."""
2020-03-08,Arterex,0,23 Year old - Creating an Investment Portfolio - Need Input and Advise!,"Hello,

I am 23 years old and living in Canada - just cashed out of my mutual funds 2 weeks ago at a surplus and i am doing extensive research and feel ETFs/index funds are the way to go for me.

$16k in TFSA (equivalent of IRA)

$5k in RRSP (retirement savings)

**I work fulltime and can contribute $500-750 every month.**

**RRSP \[5k\]**

$2500 - VOO - S&P 500

$2500 - VT - Total Stock Market

**TFSA \[16k\]**

VFH - Financial Sector - 15%

VGT - IT Sector -15%

VPU - Utilities - 10%

VYM - Dividend Focused - 10%

SPHD - Dividend Focused -10%

VTI - Large Cap Companies -40%

**Potentials : VHT - health care | VIS - Industrials | VOX - Communication | VNQ - Real estate**

**My Questions are:**

1. Is it okay to have an all ETF Portfolio? What are my risks - my pros/cons
2. I am very Vanguard focused - is there a downside to this? I use morning star quite extensively and i have seen nothing but positive feedback from this company.
3. I understand $16k isn't a lot but am i being reasonable with my allocation? Do i have too many ETFs? Which would you take out and which would you keep?
4. Currency Conversion - My funds are in CAD and i have to purchase US ETFs - I feel i need to do research in most efficient way to convert my currency to US to minimize costs and purchase the ETFs and then be able to dollar-cost average efficiently going forward.

Input would be very appreciated here!"
2020-03-10,solitude100,0,TIPS vs US Treasury Bond ETFS this week,"Over that past few months I've been long US treasuries, mainly with TLT. I additionally have a 401k that is more limited in the mutual funds that it can be invested in. There is no dedicated US treasuries fund. As the markets hit all time highs in February I'd been following the covid story and diversified the 401k out of equities and into mostly bonds. However, the only bond fund available is still mostly corporate bonds so I moved some to a TIPS mutual fund (the best option besides cash because cash isn't an option).  Throughout Jan/Feb TIPS correlated heavily with TLT, so today I expected it to be higher (based on Monday prices). However, it was down. TIPS ETFs such as TIP and STIP are down a lot today relative to the prior year so I'm expecting the mutual fund to be down even more tomorrow. Can anyone explain why this decoupling is occurring? Also, looking at the ETFS for TIPS out there ( [https://etfdb.com/etfs/bond/tips/](https://etfdb.com/etfs/bond/tips/) ) they have a huge degree of variance in price fluctuation. Any commentary or educational links in this area would be appreciated."
2020-03-20,km0010,0,Nuveen is selling 700 million muni bonds,"Nuveen is having to sell 700 million of muni bonds. These are unrated. Hard to sell because they require lots of analyst work.

This is bad news for their mutual funds. Probably significant losses for their owners. Anyway, this is yet another warning for owners of mutual funds that hold illiquid assets. Sometimes, it's better to buy a wrapper like a closed-end fund instead of a mutual fund. Look up what happened to Third Avenue's TFCIX if you've never seen this before.
