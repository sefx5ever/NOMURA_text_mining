https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/12/fed-to-pump-more-than-500-billion-into-short-term-bank-funding-expand-types-of-security-purchases.html

Just for context of the size of this:

The New York Fed increased the size of its repurchasing operations on Thursday in order to address the ""highly unusual"" disruptions in Treasurys markets. It said it would offer **$500 billion in a three-month repo operation on both Wednesday and Thursday. It also said it would offer $500 billion in a one-month repo operation tomorrow. The New York Fed added it would conduct one-month and three-month operations for $500 billion every week for the remainder of the month**. This on top of at least $175 billion in daily overnight repo operations. As part of the repo operations, the Fed will temporarily lend out funds to broker-dealers in return for collateral such as Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities. The Fed's interventions comes as market participants have worried about the difficult of trading Treasurys in the last few days."

Technically, ETFs can differ from the NAV too, especially during times of economic crisis, but that's very clear when you sell or buy. You can put in a limit order and be fine.

Most of the members are baby boomers. One of the main pieces of advice given to us by a wide variety of speakers is to not sell your stocks in a panic during a bear market or even in a huge market crash.  (Such as 2000-2002 or 2007-2009)  Instead, during a bear market, we should be buying stocks not selling them.

During the first 10 days of this crisis, we all were cocky and acted like this was not a big thing.  But as the stock market kept falling and it appeared our political and business leaders were failing us, more and more members of the club reported that they had sold most or all of their stock investments and went to bond funds.

Now the Bond Market has even turned against us.  During the last 5 days, I have seen drops in bond mutual funds that were more extreme than even the Great Recession.  Even ultra-short bond ETF's like GSY has dropped in value significantly.

2020-03-13,flatchampagne,13,Active funds have the edge on passives in week of turmoil,"[https://www.ft.com/content/d3dcd0dd-1982-4870-9803-3c2efaa23dc1](https://www.ft.com/content/d3dcd0dd-1982-4870-9803-3c2efaa23dc1)

*Article by Madison Darbyshire for the* ***Financial Times****, it is behind a paywall so here you go:*

Active managers in the UK are outperforming passive equity funds in the market sell-off, boosting longstanding claims that the former prove their mettle at times of volatility.

 “For active managers it is showtime,” said Anthony Morrow, chief executive of OpenMoney, a financial advice service. “For many years they claimed . . . that they would be judged by what happens in a downturn, sharp or not.” 

Since February 20, four out of five UK mutual funds invested in US equities outperformed the market, while 89 per cent of active UK funds outperformed. In European equities, 91 per cent of active funds beat market declines, according to analysis from fund research firm FE Fund Info.  

“Active managers did a very good job in protecting from the downside, as they avoided the most cyclical part of the markets such as energy and banks,” said Charles Younes, research manager of FE Fund Info. However, he added that active managers in Japanese and emerging markets had suffered. 

While active funds have done better relative to passives, they have still suffered heavy losses. In the year to date, the average fund in the UK All Companies sector — which includes tracker funds, but is mostly comprised of active funds — is down by 25.2 per cent on a total-return basis, compared with a 29.2 per cent decline in the index, according to Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Investment Management. 

“The best-performing funds have been those with higher exposure to smaller companies and mid-caps, as large caps have been worst hit. ESG funds have strongly outperformed, due to lack of exposure to oil and gas and typically low exposure to other commodity stocks,” he said.  Passive funds in the UK gilt market performed on par with active gilt funds over the same period, according to the data, closing the performance gap between active and passive over the year. Until the recent sell-off, only one active fund had managed to beat the benchmark.

 But actives did not outdo passives across the board. Actively managed strategic bond funds, which were down 2.9 percentage points on average, outperformed investment-grade passive bond funds, which fell 3.1 per cent, but fell short of the global bond market, which remained flat. 

Active bond funds could have performed better had they taken quick action to move into government bonds. Mr Younes said: “You could have expected them to return more, something in line with the total bond market.” 

Active managers insist they prove their worth at times of market turmoil. “It would be glib to say our active managers are rubbing their hands together with glee,” said Chris Ralph, chief global strategist at wealth manager St James’s Place, noting that drops in equity prices allow managers to pick up attractive companies for a discount. 

Mr Ralph said St James’s Place, which invests client money in its own funds, had been “outperforming the index benchmarks we have set”.  Some fund managers cautioned against declaring victory for active over passive. “Our experience is that over longer-term periods you tend to find that most active managers underperform the passive options once fees have been taken into account,” said Iain Barnes, head of portfolio management at wealth manager NetWealth. 

New data show that investors pulled more than £377m out of UK active equity funds in the first nine days of March, with £239m in outflows occurring on Monday. More than £318m was moved into passive funds, which have seen inflows every day since the beginning of March, according to data from Calastone, a funds transaction network. 

Edward Glyn, head of global markets at Calastone, said: “With markets showing such extreme volatility, trying to time entry points is a very risky strategy. Those that bought last week may already be nursing burnt fingers after the market continued to decline.”   Index trackers were hard hit in the past week because of exposure to oil and gas, which have tumbled as a result of the oil price war that erupted over the weekend.

But the 48 per cent slide in oil and gas capital returns has benefited those who chose to invest in ethical or green funds, said Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Investment Management.

He said: “Funds with exposure to mid-caps and ESG funds have done well for not having energy or commodity exposure.”  On Thursday, the FTSE 100 saw its second-biggest sell-off on record, and the S&P closed 6 per cent down, though markets recovered some of their losses in early trading on Friday. US Treasury bond yields rose this week as the market slid, and gold futures also fell. Analysts say the market has now entered bear territory after a record bull run. 

Investors received formal notification from their discretionary wealth managers on Wednesday warning them that their portfolios had lost more than 10 per cent of their value in the first quarter, a requirement under Mifid II regulatory reforms. 

“The requirement to tell clients within 24 hours that a significant loss has occurred encourages short-term thinking, and risks people making changes to their portfolio at what is almost certainly the worst possible time to do so,” said Mr Morrow, who noted an increase in appointments with advisers since the sell-off began.  

“The bigger concern is what do customers receiving these who have no adviser do and who do they turn to?” said Mr Morrow, who cautioned that letters to customers of non-advisory platforms risk increasing investor panic and fuelling a sell-off.

“Encouraging instant reactions to market volatility is dangerous and risks exactly the sort of poor outcomes that the regulator is normally working to avoid.”  Discretionary managers say it is more important than ever to communicate with clients to prepare them to receive such letters, which will go out again if a portfolio loses an additional 10 per cent, and explain what the losses mean given their target risk exposure. 

Advisers insisted that regardless of active or passive management, the best investment strategy in a crisis is a long-term one. Vanguard, which holds about $1.3tn or 25 per cent of its assets under management in active funds, reported a doubling in the number of US clients making trades on the platform.

At 3.8 per cent of clients, however, the level is still relatively low.   “Many Vanguard investors have seen the global financial crisis, they’ve seen the tech bubble, they know to stay the course,” said Jean Young, Vanguard senior research associate.  

Pointing to a study of investment activity among those holding US retirement plans in the years following the financial crisis, she said: “The most frequent traders actually had lower returns than people who didn’t trade at all.”"

2020-03-19,ltdshred,19,Bridgewater hedge funds fall further on coronavirus market rout,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-bridgewater-idUSKBN21539W

(Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates LP, the Ray Dalio-led hedge fund giant famous for making money during the 2008 financial crisis, has posted double-digit losses so far this year amid sharp market declines sparked by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a note sent to clients on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. 

Through March 16, Bridgewater’s All Weather 12% volatility “risk parity” fund fell about 14% for the year; its Pure Alpha 18% volatility hedge fund declined about 21%; and its Major Markets 14% volatility hedge fund dropped about 7%, Dalio wrote. 
Dalio wrote that the performance was “not what I would want” but was “consistent with what I would have expected under the circumstances.” 
Bridgewater has assets under management of about $160 billion, according to its website, and is trusted by some of the world’s largest investors to safeguard their money no matter the economic environment. 
The S&P 500 index tumbled 7% on Wednesday, triggering a 15-minute trading halt of Wall Street’s main indexes for the second time this week, on fears that stimulus measures may not be enough to avert a coronavirus-driven recession. 

Dalio said Bridgewater’s portfolios were positioned for relative economic strength but also had hedges on in case of an unanticipated steep market decline. The firm’s risk controls worked as designed, he said, adding that Bridgewater remained liquid and able to adjust its positions. 
“Going forward, the world has now crossed a very dangerous threshold for financial markets and economies that poses great risks for all investors,” Dalio wrote, citing interest rates falling below zero percent amid an economic downturn, inequality and populism. 

“It is one we have been preparing for for a long time.” 

CHINA RUMORS 
On Wednesday, Dalio posted on popular Chinese microblogging site Weibo to dispel rumors about a Bridgewater blow-up. 

“There has been a rumor going around China that Bridgewater has ‘crashed’ or ‘is in trouble,’ Dalio wrote, attaching the client note with the firm’s performance and views. “You have my word that that is totally false and that Bridgewater is totally safe.” 
He condemned “bad people” who spread such rumors. “I think we might have identified the rumor monger which we will pursue legally and disclose publicly if we are able.”"

They suffered sudden withdrawals of $8.1 billion over 4 days to Thursday before 30% liquidity rule could kick in. BK/Dreyfus propped up its prime m-mkt funds with $2.1 billion before 30% liquidity rule could kick in. These were 2 SEC filings on Friday. There may be more this week.

The money-market reforms of 2016 defined 3 classes of m-mkt funds and those have different rules [some automatic] that apply to them.

One of these automatic rules is that if prime m-mkt weekly liquidity [i.e. assets maturing within 5 days] falls below 30%, then the fund may suddenly and without notice impose  2% redemption fee and gates [i.e. suspend redemption] for 10 days. 

This rule almost kicked in for some GS and BK prime funds due to heavy redemption going on from prime m-mkt funds into government m-mkt funds and to other places. GS and BK decided to pump in their own money to avoid having those rules kick in and face reputational damage. They didn't have to do this and could just point to prospectus and say that was the rule.

So, ask yourself if you are using a prime money market fund for purposes so that you would be OK with paying 2% redemption fee and/or wait for 10 days to access money if the fund came under stress from heavy redemption or other unknown reasons.

You can switch to a government counterpart if needed.

This is the first time prime m-mkt funds are under stress after 2016 Reforms."
2020-03-20,elongated_smiley,3,How best to invest in a global fund with a currency that is down a lot at the moment,"I've got an unexpected nest egg to invest, but it's in a currency that has fallen over 25% in the last month (call it ABC).

I'd like to play it safe and invest in a global index fund, but I'm concerned that all my gains will be wiped out over the coming years as the currency (probably) returns to a more normal level vs larger currencies (USD, EUR).

The normal ratio to USD hovers around 1:10, but it's currently at 1:13. 

Say 1 unit of the fund I want costs 100 ABC. So I take **10000 ABC** and buy 100 units. The fund goes out and buys shares on my behalf, but a lot of what they will buy will be in USD and EUR, so currently they would get 10,000 / 13 = 769 USD worth of shares.

Now 3 years go buy. Currency has returned to 1:10 vs USD. The shares owned by the fund have risen 20% to 923 USD. Yay.

But locally my 100 units are now worth 923 x 10 = **9230 ABC** ... less than what I started with in my local currency!

That said, money markets are about as safe as you can get outside of something FDIC insured.

The short term CDs I've seen are only 1.51% and the Schwab money market fund in my account is only 1.41% without waivers. That's significantly below inflation. Are there any comparable instruments that would at least keep up with inflation?

Note: I have the vast majority of my funds in equities. This is just for our emergency fund (6x monthly expenses) so I can't risk it dropping too much in value if there was a significant market correction."

1. I don’t come from money and it is very scary to think losing 40%-50% of asset that took me many sleepless nights and anxiety ridden years of work to accumulate. 
2. I am ok with accumulating $100k-$200k less 30 years from now with the proverbial “what happens when you miss X best days”
3. There is a slight chance I might leave US and live in Asia in my home country where with what I’ll have saved in 401k with simply next 5-10 years of contributions and company match minus tax and fees  should be sufficient to live comfortable life.

2020-03-05,ilovehomeec,1,Purchased First Mutual Fund! Totally Lost Still..,"After a few weeks of studying on Mutual Funds I went ahead and zeroed out my savings account of $10,000. Its not a lot, I know, but it is what it is. 

I've been studying and studying about investments and mutual funds but there are still a plethora of questions I'm confused about that I can't find clear answers on. To be fair, it might not be clear as I'm still a novice in this.  
For example, I know I'm taxed on capital gains or when I receive dividends but to my understanding the capital gains (taxes) are only triggered when I **sell** the mutual funds. If I just park my money in there for 30 years, I won't be taxed at all, except on the funds that issue dividends, correct?

Another question I had was how I can reap my capital gains.  
For example, if a mutual fund does well and I want to sell it for some cash to use, how do I take advantage of the gains that fund might have experienced? Is my only option to sell the whole mutual fund/shares? IE. If I purchased 10K worth but now its valued at 10.5, is the only way to get my gains to sell everything?

Lastly, would I be taxed on sales that are under the initial purchase price? If I purchased 10K worth of shares in one MF but then I chose to just sell 6K worth, would I be taxed on the 6K even though the initial 10K investment was from a savings account that shouldn't be taxed?

Let's say a mutual fund has a 10% 15 year average return and a 1% annual fee (and assuming the 5 year average is also looking comperable). Then we could say the average 15 year return is 10% - 1% = 9%.

If we compare it with an ETF with a 15 year average return of 8% but a fee of 0.03%, the average annual return is roughly 8%.

Why wouldn't you choose the Mutual fund?  I understand not every year will be the same, but over time wouldn't you be better off?  At the moment 50% of my holdings are in high performance (but high cost MFs).

Can someone explain their reasoning?

My thinking was lower interest rates means the fed bought treasuries to inject money into the banking system.  This decreases the supply of bonds for sale.  The shift in the supply curve to the left increases the price of the bond, while decreasing the interest rate (I do think I have a good understanding of the inverse relationship between bond prices and their interest rates).

I guess my biggest issue is understanding the relationship between the fed funds rate and the interest rates on bonds - I feel like these terms are all used interchangeably.  If banks are lending to eachother overnight at lower rates, why would they then charge a higher rate for bonds.

Would appreciate any help.  Thanks"
2019-12-17,MasterCookSwag,203,Experience a large unexpected drop in your mutual fund recently? Read this before making your own post please.,"Every year in December we start to get 5-10 posts a day asking this question. Rather than have a ton of clutter in the sub I'm going to be stickying this post until the end of the month.

A mutual fund is essentially just a basket of individual stocks/bonds/whatever. Within that basket the fund managers are constantly selling/buying and receiving dividends. The IRS has special rules for mutual funds which allow them to not pay taxes on the capital gains/dividends generated provided they pass through almost all of the proceeds from said activities to the shareholder within the calendar year. So dividends are often paid on some set schedule but capital gains are generally retained within the fund till the end of the year(because losses can reduce gains but can't be distributed to a shareholder). 

So on to why your fund dropped: in mid December everyone starts distributing these gains and as we know when a fund makes a distribution its NAV drops by an equal amount. For example a fund that was trading at $10 and had It's value made up of $9 worth of stock and $1 worth of cash to be distributed now no longer has that $1. So it'll drop by 10% because of that fact. Don't worry, you didn't lose any money because the $1 was paid to you in cash(and in most cases reinvested in the form of buying more shares).

There isn't any value created or lost in a distribution(except to taxes) it's just a necessary taxable transaction that must occur because of how mutual funds are structured. Etfs are technically subject to this as well but since most follow passive cap weighted strategies they don't usually have capital gains realized to distribute.

Also please feel free to add whatever questions/comments you have to this sticky.

Here's a quick way to see what capital gains estimates/distribution dates are for most funds: 

https://mutualfundobserver.com/discuss/discussion/52943/2019-capital-gains-distribution-estimates

Ctrl + f your fund family. Chances are it's on one of these two pages. If not, google search ""______ funds capital gains distributions 2016""

Please note we'll probably be deleting any threads on the subject and pointing people here in order to keep the clutter down."
2020-03-07,pamplemusique,0,What is the point of index mutual funds now that index ETFs exist?,"Been paying more attention to the market the last couple of weeks. I don’t believe I’m smarter than a bunch of equity researchers, so I just buy a few broad indexes. On multiple recent days I had a theory about what VTI should be worth and made a conscious effort to pay attention to its closing price in the last 10 minutes of the trading day to decide how much to put into VTSAX. It would have been so much easier if I had a limit order on VTI at what I thought it was worth and let that execute if it hit than to watch the market like that.

So given those dynamics, why should anyone invest in indexed mutual funds when comparable ETFs exist, like VTSAX over VTI? Is there some kind of protection in them that I’m not seeing that’s worth the ever so slightly higher expense ratio? Is the only benefit to mutual funds being able to buy $ amounts and not only entire shares?"

The proposal in question is [34-87607](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed.shtml) (scroll down and find that one to open the pdf).

1. ProShares argues that the qualification process could be ""overly burdensome"" and that some ""brokerage firms could even stop offering these funds altogether due to the difficulty of implementing the regulations.""
 * This sounds pretty bad, but I don't have the experience necessary to judge whether or not their scenario is plausible. Anyone want to weigh in here?
2. They argue that ""the SEC has not shown there is a problem that needs to be solved with respect to leveraged and inverse funds.""
 * What is the precedent here? Does the SEC usually feel compelled to wait until *after* a problem arises before addressing it? Or are they wont to make attempts at addressing problems before they arise? If the latter, how often have they issued mea culpas and repealed their regulations, on the grounds that they were actually unnecessary to begin with?
3. They argue that ""requiring you to qualify to purchase a security in the public markets would be an unjustified break with how the SEC's regulation of the sale of securities ... has worked for nearly 90 years.""
 * Again, I don't feel *qualified* to judge this statement. How different would this be from precedent? In particular, how different is this from the questionnaire you have to answer in order to buy and sell options? Is the difference that *that* questionnaire is a requirement set purely by your brokerage, and not by the SEC?

2020-01-24,fact_seeker,55,"Article comparing value vs growth, large vs mid vs small-cap funds","This is a slightly dated but helpful article on value versus growth investing:  [https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/value-investing-vs-growth-investing](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/trading/value-investing-vs-growth-investing) 

The article compares value versus growth portfolios in different asset classes from 1990-2015.  As a relatively inexperienced investor, it has always felt like growth funds were the way to go and that it was a waste to put money into value funds. That article shows that value funds performed noticeably better than growth funds over that period. As I said, the article is about 5 years old, so I suspect the results would slightly favor growth funds if rewritten today. Ironically, the article states that perhaps you should tilt toward value funds, which would be poor advice for the last five years!

Some takeaways from someone who is still learning a lot:

1. While growth funds may seem like the way to go now, value funds frequently outperform growth funds. So unsurprisingly, it's a good idea to have a blend that captures the overall performance of the market.
2. The volatility (fluctuations in price) are dramatically greater for growth funds, so you probably need to be a bit more comfortable with big changes to focus on growth funds.
3. The volatility of mid-cap and small-cap funds tends to be higher than their large-cap counterparts.
4. Mid-cap and small-cap funds often outperform their large-cap counterparts. (This is surprising to me because we talk so much about companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, etc.) However, large-caps seem to have dominated overall the past 5 years or so.

I'm sure this is all pretty basic stuff for the experienced investor, but it was refreshing for me as a novice to see some real data confirming the statements that are frequently made in r/investing."

I was wondering what you guys usually do when buying stocks on the weekend or when market is closed? I can't purchase stocks during the weekday due to work so I usually only have time at night. What I am worried about is if I buy a market order during the market close, and there is an unnatural spike when the market is open I might spend way more than I wanted too. Lets say the stock is $100 at market close, would I put a limit order at like $101, that way if the price goes way above $101 when the market opens, the purchase would cancel? Or would I do like $99 as my limit order? Thanks!"

But 2% is a *short term anomaly*.  Historically, the Fed had to cut 5% to get us out of a recession.  5% fed fund rate is *a healthy economy and full normalization*.

Therefore, using a 5% fed fund rate for DCF, stocks are very overvalued.

BUYING at these prices is mainly chasing the repo liquidity, which is fine, but the long term, it seems like a dangerous play because its based on liquidity and not fundamentals.

THE other corollary is that well be at 2% or lower for longer implying stock prices are elevated and not in a bubble. BUT if you hold that view you must also accept we are in a liquidity trap.  IMPLYING that if the Fed ever reduces the balance sheet the financial markets will collapse."

2020-01-31,zdrmju321,13,Letter from PROSHARES - SEC proposing restrictions and qualification on leveraged and inverse funds Stocks," 

Dear ProShares Shareholder,

I am writing to let you know about an unprecedented proposal from the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) that would make it more burdensome to buy, or even prevent you from buying, leveraged and inverse funds, such as the ones offered by ProShares. You have the right to offer your view on these proposed regulations, which you can do by submitting comments to the SEC through [www.fundcomments.com](https://www.fundcomments.com/).

The Proposed Regulations

Under the proposed regulations, you would be required to provide extensive personal financial and other information and be evaluated to determine if you will be allowed to buy leveraged and inverse funds. This would be the case even if you make your own investment decisions or you have engaged a financial professional to make those decisions for you.

We strongly believe the proposed regulations are:

1. Bad for Investors. If the proposal is adopted, some investors who could benefit from the enhanced return and portfolio protection potential of leveraged and inverse funds could be prevented from buying them by an overly burdensome qualification process. Brokerage firms could even stop offering these funds altogether due to the difficulty of implementing the regulations.
2. Unnecessary. The SEC has not shown there is a problem that needs to be solved with respect to leveraged and inverse funds. They fail to show why these funds should be treated differently than tens of thousands of other public securities, each with their own characteristics and risks.
3. A Dangerous Precedent. Requiring you to qualify to purchase a security in the public markets would be an unjustified break with how the SEC’s regulation of the sale of securities in the public markets has worked for nearly 90 years. The proposal would be at odds with our long-standing system that gives investors and their advisors the freedom to make their own investment decisions.

What You Can Do

You have the right to voice your view by submitting comments on this proposal. The SEC is required to take your comments into consideration in deciding whether to go forward with the rule as proposed.

If you would like to let your views be known, you can submit comments to the SEC through [www.fundcomments.com](https://www.fundcomments.com/). The deadline to make comments is March 24, 2020, so consider acting now.

(continued on reverse)

We encourage you to submit your views on the proposed regulations, including, if you agree, that:

• Leveraged and inverse funds are important to you, and they allow you to seek enhanced returns or help you protect your portfolio.

• You are capable of understanding leveraged and inverse funds and their performance characteristics, and you don’t want a third party evaluating your capability to do so and potentially preventing you from buying them.

• You want to preserve the long-standing free public markets where investors and their advisors have the freedom to buy public securities without additional government-imposed limitations on investor choice.

\*\*\*

Having spoken with ProShares shareholders over the last 13 years, I believe it is likely you value leveraged and inverse funds. I hope you will join me in telling the SEC you want to maintain your current access to these funds.

For more information about the proposal, visit [www.sec.gov/rules/proposed.shtml](https://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed.shtml) and go to Release No. 34-87607, dated November 25, 2019. If you have questions for us regarding this matter or how to submit comments, please contact our investor line at 888-776-3898, or email us at secproposalatproshares.com.

As always, thank you for having made the decision to be a ProShares shareholder. We look forward to continuing to provide exchange-traded funds that empower you to pursue your financial objectives.

Sincerely,

Michael L. Sapir Chairman.

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” White House aide Eric Ueland announced at the Capitol just after midnight.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.

However it occurs to me that, with my employer contributions, I'm putting about £800/month into a global fund via my pension.

Am I being too conservative by limiting myself to 20% stocks?  I know that I won't be able to access my pension for ages (I'm 32), but I'm in a position to experiment a bit more and aim for some shorter term growth as my current liquid cash position is strong.  I've been doing research into some companies recently and I'm keen to take a punt.

I'm just a bit wary of pitfalls as I'm still new to investing."
2020-02-21,wheelsjr,0,Index Funds Buying Derivatives?,"Hi folks,

As per the recent discussion from Michael Burry on how indexes may be inhibiting price discovery:

> “Potentially making it worse will be the impossibility of unwinding the  derivatives and naked buy/sell strategies used to help so many of these  funds pseudo-match flows and prices each and every day. This fundamental  concept is the same one that resulted in the market meltdowns in 2008.  However, I just don’t know what the timeline will be. Like most bubbles,  the longer it goes on, the worse the crash will be.” 

I'm left wondering: how/what type of derivatives these large indexes may be buying to ""mimic"" the fluctuations of their smaller cap constituents? Are they using some sort of spread strategy?

My uncle gave me a little bit of info on stocks, ETFs index funds and mutual funds. Fast forward to today, after having done lots of research on my own, I have $6,750.65 total in my portfolio, and I plan on adding $100 a month to the FXAIX index fund.

The majority of my money is in the FXAIX index fund, with $5,014.11. I also have 2 Roku shares that I bought early this year for around $102, and 2 Alibaba shares for $157. I also invested in the FCOM, FTEC, and FREL ETFs, with FCOM and FTEC going up 10.57% and 18,45% since I bought them. I also have 3 Disney shares that I bought earlier this year for $137.65. My only loser so far is CGC, which has dropped 54% since I bought them (6 shares). I am not too worried though because I believe in 5, 10 or even 20 years from now that the value will be a lot higher because marijuana is becoming more generally accepted in the world. 

I want to know what you all think of my portfolio from what I described. Am I on pace for a good sum of money if I were to sell it all in 40 years? Did I choose the right index funds and stocks? What am I doing right/wrong? What else can I do to improve? I appreciate any and every comment!"

Hi!  I’m a renewable energy engineer and work on technical due diligence for rather large ($10M our more) investments. 

Want to build an ESG investment portfolio, somewhat mirroring the Three Fund Portfolio, balanced among US stock, International stock, and Bonds. 

In particular, I want to figure out a portfolio that achieves the following:
* ESG or similar 
* balance between US stock, International Stock, and Bonds
* max three funds
* available through Vanguard. 
* beta less than or equal to 1
* alpha greater than 1
* history encompassing the last major crisis in 2008

So far, I’ve identified the following:
* VFTNX - appears to be a good stocks fund, but I don’t know what balance of international and US. 
* VSGX - very young fund, I would love to “project” its performance backwards a few years to see how it might have performed since the crash, but I don’t know how. 
* ESGV - similar to VSGX
* VWAHX - not strictly ESG, but is municipal bonds so can’t really be doing much harm AFAIK. 

Any thoughts/pointers?  Thanks!"

2020-02-07,Take_Notice_Walk,0,How do Bond ETFs compare to buying Bonds directly or Bond Funds? (And a bunch other Bond questions I have).,"I am thinking about buying bonds. I am currently in my late 20s, and only been investing for like 6 months. I am 100% in equities, atm. The gains have been nice, but if I'm going to be honest with myself, I don't know how I will do in a bear market. So I would like to diversify. I was thinking about putting 10-20% of my investments into buying Bonds and Gold ( $SGOL ).

Since I don't really understand Bonds, I was thinking of just buying Vanguard Bond ETFs instead of buying them directly. I would think about a low cost bond index fund, but I am with Merrill and I feel their Bond/Fund screener is a little complicated and clunky.

&#x200B;

Anyways, is investing in Bond ETFs a good idea? How does it compare to buying bonds directly? Will the expense ratio kill whatever gains I make from the bonds?

I know with bonds, there's usually a time period for it (1, 5, 10, 30 year etc). With Bond ETFs, do you actually have to hold it for that amount of time to avoid penalties? Or can you sell whenever you want without penalties?

Is it dumb to keep bonds in a taxable account? I'm already maxed out in my Roth IRAs.

Since I am already invested in a lot of corporations, should I stay away from full Corporate Bonds?

&#x200B;

Here are the Bond ETFs I was thinking of:

$BND (total bond fund), $BSV (short term), $BIV (intermediate) , $BLV (long term), $VTEB (tax exempt bond).

What do you think?

I was thinking about putting $5,000 into bonds. I was thinking of keeping it simple and just putting it all in $BND?

2020-02-13,wazzup_izurboi,2,ETF Bubble VS. Minimal Fund Overlap,"I’m hearing about an ETF bubble from big voices in the industry (don’t want to name names to create a bias)... one of the arguments in particular being that the same companies are littered across a lot of ETFs to help them achieve a certain level of liquidity and growth meaning:

1) The price of these stocks is being bid up and inflated because ETF investors don’t know their buying it/don’t know why. 

2) Investors think they are diversified, when in reality they aren’t because they own a bunch of the same stocks.

3). If indexing is “hot” right now, inflows to ETFs will slow and the prices will plummet once ETFs peak

So, I used a 1:1 fund-overlap analysis tool online to see where my ETF overlap is. Sure enough, I had some overlap, mainly in VTV : VTI, and VTI : VUG (which I expected.. I have a brokerage acct so the low expense VUG is there, and an IRA so the VTV is there. I have VTI in both). Otherwise, it’s basically 0% overlap weighted. Without going into further detail about which ETFs I own, I’ve got exposure to emerging markets, International Developed, Small-Cap US, large cap US, mid-cap, across every major industry verticals.

I’m of the opinion that there isn’t an ETF bubble - that most of the trading volume of individual securities is being done by high-frequency trading outfits, and not by Joe-shmo buying ETFs... 

Any other opinions on this great ETF bubble debate? AND, If, I have basically zero fund overlap, how am I exposed to said bubble (if it exists)?

&#x200B;

>“[Research](https://www.callan.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Callan-Active-Passive-4Q2018.pdf) (paper HERE) shows that, with appropriate fee levels, carefully selected actively managed funds will more often than not outperform the benchmark index over long periods of time in some asset classes. This applies to fixed income, small and mid-cap equity, and international equity asset classes, so we are removing the Bond, Small Cap, Mid Cap, and International Index Funds from the Core Investment Fund lineup. We are maintaining the Large Cap Index Fund because research shows that actively managed funds are unlikely to outperform the index in this asset class.”

&#x200B;

The research paper they quote does suggest this, but the paper is extremely vague and there’s no methodology included. I’ve been heavily influenced by and follow Jack Bogle's investment philosophies, so I have a really hard time believing that an actively managed funds will beat an index in any category. 

My current situation is this:

I have my 401k using a target date fund and IRA’s with a 4 Vanguard ETF portfolio (VTI/VXUS in Roth and BND/BNDX in Traditional). The new actively managed target date fund is charging .3% fees and my IRA ETF’s run average about 0.06%. I have the ability to convert my 401K to a PCRA and create the same ETF portfolio with the vast majority of my funds.

My question are these:

Is it BS that these actively managed funds can outperform an index?

Would be worth self-managing my 401k for the fee break alone?

(Reuters) - Index funds now control half the U.S. stock mutual fund market, giving the biggest funds enormous power to influence decisions and demand better returns at the companies in which they invest trillions of dollars.

But the leading U.S. index fund firms, BlackRock Inc, Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, rarely use that clout. Instead, they overwhelmingly support the decisions and pay packages of executives at the companies in their portfolios, including the worst performers, according to a Reuters analysis of their shareholder-voting records."

Article behind paywall so here you go:

Solus Alternative Asset Management, one of the best known specialists in distressed investments, is closing its flagship fund after suffering a combination of heavy redemptions and poor performance.

The hedge fund, which as recently as November managed $4.3bn in assets, is one of the first casualties of a collapse in the price of riskier assets this week. In a letter to investors in its Sola vehicle on Tuesday, the firm offered them the option to transfer their investments into new funds or face “an orderly liquidation” that would return their funds “as soon as practicable”.

“Due to the evolving state of the markets, this has left our flagship fund Sola with a high concentration of less liquid assets,” the letter said.


The Financial Times reported in December that Sola had suffered big losses after making a number of ill-fated bets on companies including satellite operator Intelsat and Pacific Gas and Electric. The fund finished the year down more than 8 per cent, after a 15 per cent drop in 2018. It had assets of about $4bn at the turn of the year.

Solus’s letter to investors said that “unexpected withdrawal requests” had followed reports of the firm’s difficulties in the financial press.

The company declined to comment.

Solus emerged as one of the most high-profile distressed investment firms in the US after its skirmish with Toys R Us employees in 2018 and a legal battle over derivatives with a Blackstone-owned hedge fund, GSO Capital Partners.

Now, though, it has become a victim of a string of corporate collapses that have tripped up US distressed investment funds, which look to profit from buying stocks and bonds of struggling companies at bargain prices.

Shares in Intelsat, a heavily indebted satellite group popular with hedge funds, collapsed as much as 75 per cent in November after a US regulator rejected its plans to raise money by selling off its airwaves. Some of the company’s bonds are now trading at about one-third of face value, as bondholders are braced for a potential wipeout.

Shares in two of Solus’s other equity investments, US coalminer Contura Energy and offshore drilling services group Hornbeck, both dropped about 90 per cent last year.

An investor report from January showed that 22 per cent of Sola’s exposure was to “energy equipment and services” companies: a sector that has been hit by a growing distaste among investors towards fossil fuels and, more recently, a sharp fall in the oil price.

Many other distressed specialists are smarting from bets on energy-related companies turning sour. Blackstone’s GSO faced ruptures in its distressed investment unit last year, for example, due in part to bad bets on ailing oil and gas groups, such as Oklahoma-based Tapstone Energy.

Investors who stick with Solus face two options.

They can switch over to what the firm calls a “long-term opportunities” fund that looks to invest in thinly traded assets. Alternatively, they can lock up their investments until 2021, by which time Solus will sell its illiquid holdings and reinvest the proceeds in more easily tradeable assets."
2020-03-02,chargum,0,"In a Bear Market, it is much better to break your investments in separate total stock and total bond funds than use balanced mutual funds in retirement","I want to show you the math behind the advantages of having separate total stock and total bond funds vs using balanced mutual funds.

Jim retired on October 1st, 2007 and had 2 Million Dollars in his 401K retirement account and is using the 4% rule and is planning on withdrawing a starting figure of $6666 a month which will be adjusted for inflation. He has two accounts 60% of his money is in a total stock market fund and 40% in a total bond market fund. Just when he retires the stock market starts to crash so he pulls his $6666 a month withdrawal out of his bond fund so he does not sell his stocks when they are down. On March 1, 2009, just before the stock market hits bottom he has $955,736 in his total Bond Fund and $519,680 in his total stock market fund. ($1,475,416 combined) Starting in March 2009 he took his monthly withdrawals equally from both funds. On February 2020 he has $2,598,449 left.

Peter also retired on October 2007 and had $2 Million in retirement and put it all in a 60-40 Mutual Fund. On March 1st he had $1,164,377 in his Balanced 60-40 Mutual Fund (FBALX) He took an inflation-adjusted starting amount of $6666.00 a month out of that fund from October 2007 to February 2020. So, in the end, on February 2020 he had $2,489,195 left.

Why the difference? Because Peter used a balanced mutual fund that was selling stocks during the Great Recession (due to the investment having 60% in stocks). While Jim only withdrew from his bond funds during the 2007-2009 stock market crash.

* *Each individual weighting is also capped by the ratio between the logarithm of its market cap and the logarithm of the largest asset.*

2020-01-01,CautiousInvestor,14,Hedge-Fund Purge Deepens as $3 Trillion Market Retrenches.,"2019 marks the 5th straight year of negative net openings - i.e. more hedge-funds closed than opened. It's the 2nd worst year of this streak: net openings were -149, vs -328 in the worst year, 2016. Overall, more than hedge-funds 4,000 died during this streak.

The S&P 500 performed exceptionally well, delivering a 28% gain this year through November, while hedge-fund returns were poor, with the Bloomberg Equity Hedge Fund Index at only 10%. These are poor returns in an absolute sense, not just compared to S&P performance. In other words, even if S&P performance was average, these would be poor returns considering the high management fees charged by hedge-funds. January through November 2019 saw a total flow of $81.5 out of hedge-funds.

The article contains a list of notable hedge-funds that shut down this year. You'll notice some pretty well-known names in that list, including a Citadel fund:

2020-03-10,FinndBors,414,"PSA: Individual Stocks don't always ""come back""","I see tons of posts saying, oil has gone down hard, or cruise companies and airline companies have gone down, there will be a bounce back.

They don't always come back, especially if there is absolutely no reason for them to. A lot of these players may go to zero. You may think, well, there still needs to be airlines and oil companies, etc. so they'll still be around. And these companies will likely continue. But the company may default on their debt and the debt holders will now own the company and the shareholders will be wiped out. You could make a decent analysis by looking at their debt, revenue and make a reasonable guess of revenue hit from COVID19, but posters here seem to not bother with this, it is a ""what goes down must come up"" mentality.

This statement doesn't apply to broad index funds. They do eventually come back, but nobody knows when. You can do your own research on how long it takes for stocks to go back to their highs. It can take years or decades for big drops. If you are 20 years old, no big deal. If you are 60, you really shouldn't be in 100% stocks."

Sadly it looks like the fund has a $25 mio. minimum investment.

Having 96.7% of your investments in SPY and 3.3% in OTM SPY puts and long VOL options seems like an ideal portfolio for me that combines the best of both worlds. You would profit from the big diversification and relatively safety of an ETF tracking the S&P 500 as well as exponential WSB YOLO returns (at least on your 3.3%) in times of market downturns like we have currently that would protect your assets and let you sleep well no matter how bad it looks.

When would be a good time to harvest profits? I've been putting money in it every month so while a lot of it is long term gain, some are short term.

I'd like to shave off about $1K at a time for a few months (sells happen with the oldest bought shares so that's good for LT cap gains.

I'll continue to auto invest every month but does this profit harvesting make sense? Would you do it, too? I feel this is a better approach than dividend investing (but that's just me)."
2020-02-07,NegativeTangibleBook,8,Large money market fund flows,"What’s your take?

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=q6wr

2019 was all about the Fed backpedaling on their hawkishness so flows aren’t a function of higher rates (see below), and coupled with this was rising asset (broad) prices. 

These spikes in flows seem to have happened prior to last two recessions, but Fed was tightening so not overly surprising you’d see strong flows in that environment.

Also wondering if this may be a function of heavy marketing by FIs promoting higher yields on MMF versus average rate at a bank, etc."

When I first started investing, I chose mutual funds, particularly through MFS investment management just because it seemed like the best option at the time. I stopped contributing to these funds around March of 2019 and have allocated my future contributions to other areas. I have money spread between MEIAX, MTCAX, MAGWX, and MMACX. These have given me pretty decent returns, but the fees are pretty hefty compared to ETFs, and ETFs seem to perform better overall. This is money I think would be better invested in vanguard ETFs long term. Does anyone have any reason it would be advantageous to stick with these mutual funds, or is there anything in particular about this management company that sets these funds apart? Also, for tax purposes, most of this money has been invested for over a year aside from the capital gains, and roughly $500 that was added to it by myself."

2020-03-25,hotrodfantasy,220,CNBC: Negative rates come to the US: 1-month and 3-month Treasury bill yields are now below zero,"The coronavirus crisis has brought another first to U.S. financial markets — negative yields on government debt.

Yields on both the one-month and three-month Treasury bills dipped below zero Wednesday, a week and a half after the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark rate to near-zero and as investors have flocked to the safety of fixed income amid general market turmoil.

It was the first time that happened in 4½ years, when both bills briefly flashed red and yields fell to minus-0.002% each. The readings Wednesday were well below those.

“This is part and parcel of the whole flight to quality thing,” said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics. “They’re obviously the most liquid instrument. We saw a lot of selling pressure a few days ago when everyone was selling everything to get cash. But with all the plans the Fed has introduced, the bill market is much safer.”

The U.S. now joins large swaths of Europe and Japan that also have negative-yielding debt.

In Germany, the move was even more prevalent, with all government fixed income instruments except the 30-year bond carrying rates below zero. Denmark, France and Sweden are among other European nations also in the category.

Negative yields are largely a function of demand, as prices and yields move in opposite direction for bonds. Investors pay a large premium above par on the bonds and can receive less than their initial investment at maturity. Deposit rates also can be negative.

The negative rates, however, are not directly related to central bank policy. Fed officials have rejected the notion that the U.S. central bank might eventually take its policy rate below zero.

However, that might not matter if current market trends hold. While longer-duration Treasurys are still a good ways from negative territory, the trend for yields is lower.

“There’s no telling anymore in this environment. They could spread,” Rupert said. “Everyone is expecting the Fed to be lower for longer, and I mean longer.  The whole bias is for yields to go lower. I would not rule out the front end of the curve going negative.”

2020-02-28,progman2000,2658,My Coronavirus Stock Portfolio strategy,"Thought I would add something for a change, take this FWIW. Here is my strategy: 

1 - DCA
I am buying this week. I will be buying next week and the week after. Catch a falling knife, wait for the bottom, blahs blahs blahs. I am buying. I am mostly in index funds, although I have positions in several large companies also. I have been around a while, possibly longer than many people here. I was also buying in 2008 when people were freaking out and I have done quite well

2 - Unsubscribe from this sub
Seriously. This place has become a fear mongering echo chamber lately. Last week people were asking if they should buy at all time highs. Now people are shitting themselves because everything is on sale. I am going to Unsubscribe and try to focus more on my side hustles to generate more cash for buying (see item #1). I am not saying this to be a dick. I am saying it because it is legit unhealthy to freak out and surround yourself with other people that are freaking out.

Take a deep breath. New flu strains surface from time to time, it is very cyclical. Yes, things will get a little worse, but it will rebound and people who buy will be the beneficiaries (don't buy with your rent money obviously,  just be smart). Watch what happens when a vaccine is announced.

Just my two cents. I am going to Unsubscribe now and go for a run. Because good mental & physical health is key.

I already have ETFs like VOO, VOOG, VTI, but I want to buy into a mutual fund so that I can DCA easier and I wouldn’t have to worry about buying whole shares of ETFs. 

Are things like these LifeStrategy funds (ER: ~0.14%) a good bet? Or is keeping it more basic with a regular Balanced fund (VBIAX, ER: 0.07%) or S&P index (VFIAX, ER: 0.04%) a better long term strategy?"

I realize that this journal entry got a bit lengthy, so I chopped it into three parts, plus a very hand-wavy speculative conclusion part.

----     
The Pump  
-----     

Mid-January 2020, articles begin pumping TSLA as Musk announces share purchases.    
    
_Markets Insider -  Tesla short sellers have lost nearly $12 billion in just 7 weeks_     
     
_Markets Insider - Tesla has yet another biggest bull on Wall Street. Here's why he thinks the stock could surge 57%._    
     
_Electrek - Tesla (TSLA) gets new $800 price target based on its ability to execute_        
     
Musk is no stranger to stock pumping. Last year he advertised a private share price of 420$, ""funding secured"", to draw in investors. It is not surprising that this time the company (or another party) has turned to media outlets to get article placement from a third party. It is frowned-upon, but not uncommon, for companies to pay journalists, through brokers, to place articles in major publications.   

At the same time, mid-January, coordinated social media and message board posts appeared hyping TSLA and urging users to buy stock. Social media posts appeared on reddit, twitter, facebook about the price of Tesla on trajectory for $1000/share. Many influential users were caught in the frenzy and spread the word. A reddit and twitter user named /u/WSBgod began buying calls in TSLA at $600+; posting his positions and urging his large follower base to do the same. Many of these social media posts were well-written, edgy and bear the hallmarks of professional  copywriters.    

----    
The Dump    
----   
Tesla price began to rise. Viral social media posts and positive articles created high demand for TSLA stock, driving retail investors into a frenzy. On some message boards, users were seen urging people to take credit card advances or student loans to buy Tesla stock at $600+.   

At this point, a short-term ""spike"" in Teslas price occured. For the purposes of discussion, we will consider $767 (the stock issue price, discussed below) at market close to be the defining price of the spike.   

This spike began on 02/03 and ended on 02/26. The stock market was open 18 days  during this window. More remarkably, the closing price of TSLA was only above $767 per share on *12 days* during the window.   
**Chart of the 767$ price line and the recent spike**:   
https://gfycat.com/quaintslimyeuropeanpolecat   

It turns out this short stock market spike was no surprise to Tesla. Tesla and Goldman Sachs were already preparing to issue stock during this narrow period. Tesla filed an 8-K on 02/19 to issue  2.65 million new shares at $767 per share. Teslas/Goldman's  ""luck"" allowed them to issue on one of the top ten highest dates in TSLA history.    

Social media and message board influencers sold dreams of $1500 ""moon"" prices to middle-class retail investors. Many of his new investors were young; drawn by the new mobile-based, zero-commision brokers such as Robinhood. These younger investors typically turn to social media for their stock research. 

Many new and inexperienced investors are unfamiliar with stock ""dilution"" (the concept that issuing new stock devalues existing shareholders). Some shareholders even took to message boards to praise Tesla/Goldman for issuing more shares. Tesla raked in $2.31 billion of that cash advance, student loan, and summer job money during this short period of time, by issuing new shares at the $767 price.    

While the stock issue was happening, insiders began exercising options and dumping their stock. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with insiders selling stock. However  they were *very lucky* that this period happened mid-February - directly in-between earnings calls. This is one of the few timeframes outside of their blackout dates (blackout dates tend to cover most dates in the year for executives, particularly around earnings).

Five insiders can be seen exercising (buying) options and dumping stock during the narrow 18-day February spike time frame. Amidst the insider sales there is only one insider purchase - a well-publicized stock purchase by Elon Musk himself.     

https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/TSLA/insider-trades/    

----     
The wreckage settles     
----     

After the dump finished, the retail investor money was safely in the hands of insiders and Teslas cash reserves. Nameless large traders (known as ""whales"") began dumping the shares in high-volume batches, reaping the final harvest of the inflated stock price. Coincidentally, Covid-19 caused a general decrease in stock prices on the NYSE. The stock price plummeted. TSLA is now hovering around ~$400/share on 03/18, less than half the price of the all-time high where retail investors were paying upwards of $800-900 per share.    

Tesla is now $2.31 billion richer (although Tesla's high cash burn rate will incinerate this money within two quarters). Insiders at Tesla have gained hundreds of millions from their timely exit.    

On twitter and message boards, many users are depressed and downtrodden. The investment they purchased during the flurry of hype has lost its value. Many of the users who bought TSLA now joke about suicide or selling their house. Many users who got caught in the Tesla hype are silent - ashamed of their losses. Many are selling their devalued shares at a huge loss and will not return to invest in stocks for the time being.      

-----   
The other kind of speculation   
----    
Stock frenzys are not a new phenomenon. We can blame the media for the unrealistic moonshot expectations towards TSLA during the hype period.     
    
Yet, it is tough not to look at the timing of the entire event and squint:    
* The company orchestrated one of its largest stock issues during a very narrow 12 day market peak window -  a masterstroke in perfect timing and preparation     
* The media blitz ""pump"" occurred despite Teslas high debt load and extremely low car production rate (400k/year).     
* Institutional investors stayed put and let retail investors run in to the slaughter, chasing promises of $1000+ TSLA    
* Tesla insiders dumped their stock during this period       
    
Sadly, the SEC has been in a deep slumber for the past two decades. With the tech industry oligopolies running amok; plus thousands of pump-and-dumps that could only be orchestrated in a now socially-interconnected world, we need their enforcement now more than ever.     
    
Maybe there is some mythical horn we have to blow to rouse the SEC from its slumber. Until then, we can only look at incidents like this and squint at the happenstance. I hope that people far smarter and better researched than myself will look into the Tesla spike and verify that everything is above-board.    
     
""Funding secured""

-----
Edit: Counterpoints
-----

There are a few aspects of this situation that go against my hypothesis that the price was pumped.

* The dump occurred during the Covid-19 outbreak. It is difficult to seperate market manipulation from the general downturn during this period   
* Tesla insiders still hold a large portion of TSLA stock   
* Musk himself purchased stock during the spike. (This is a good point, although I don't believe the stock purchase represents a major buy, considering Musk's enormous wealth. Teslas survival is a point of personal pride to Musk. He has been known to play dirty when his reputation is threatened - he once hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on a dive instructor from Thailand that snubbed him)
* The price rose due to the short squeeze. (This is a counterargument I generally disagree with. The short interest was orders of magnitude smaller than the purchase volume that drove the price to $900+)"

2020-01-17,Phantomhive5,1,How do I calculate the 'overall' return from investing in a fund via DCA?,"I think what I'm trying to calculate here is annualized return, but not sure if it's actually CAGR (honestly I don't really understand the difference between these 2). Let's say I have this scenario: I invest $X amount every month. After Y months, I have a total value of $Z. How do I calculate a representative rate of return considering that I made multiple investments whereby the unit price differs every month? I believe that regardless of whether it's an ETF or mutual fund, whether the portfolio holdings change entirely, etc., they do not matter. At the end of the day, my present value is [the no. of units I have * current unit price]. Therefore, the purchases on those months when I was able to buy more units, would be the ones that affect my rate of return more. Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"

It’s offering them three months of service.

>A month of Robinhood Gold costs $5 plus 5% yearly interest on borrowing above $1,000, charged daily. Before a pricing change, the flat fee per month could range as high as $200. However, compensated users will only get the $5 off per month, for a total of $15. That could seem woefully insufficient if Robinhood users missed out on buying back into stocks like Apple that went up over 9% on Monday. Robinhood is calling it a “first step”.

Cassandra Capital just published an article that is now top on Hacker News. What are this subs comments on this?

EDIT: I too, think the article is too sensational and doesn't appear to be very well researched. I mainly posted it because it was on top of Hacker News. Despite this, is the main point reasonable (ignoring how good the author's arguments may be)?"
