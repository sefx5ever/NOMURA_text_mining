2019-09-01,MasterCookSwag,269,Formal posting guidelines for political topics and what constitutes investment vs corporate news. **READ BEFORE COMMENTING IN THIS SUB PLEASE**,"Alright everyone, it looks like we had pretty broad support in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/cuuo6j/yooo_get_in_here_peeps_state_of_the_subreddit/) when it comes to cracking down on the hyper partisanship that's been spilling out of the political subreddits to all corners of reddit.  In this thread I'm going to lay out some formal guidelines for comments on political topics.  Since this is so widespread I want to be clear here: this post is everyone's formal warning.  That means temporary or in some cases permanent bans are being handed out for people who violate said guidelines immediately.  This is really the only way to deal wit this issue.  I'm going to try to get automod to sticky applicable threads with this post as well.   

**First lets address politics**

I want to note something first: we are absolutely enforcing higher posting standards for political threads.  I think it's entirely uncontroversial to point out that calling Warren Buffett an asshole doesn't nearly stir up the anger that calling any given political figure an asshole will.  Comments like that being upvoted quickly derail threads and drive the discussion away from investing.  

**So here's the simple guideline which I'll expand on: you're free to express your opinion so long as it's tied to investing, you put effort in to it, and it's civil.**  We're not here to stop the free flow of discussion or ideas but we are here to keep discussion surrounding investing and civil.

**Tied to investing:** this should be pretty straightforward but I'm laying it out here anyway.  Investing encompasses markets, economic impacts, corporate profits, shifts in the yield curve, the federal reserve, taxes, potential government spending that may impact your portfolio.  

Investing does not encompass immigration, personal lives of politicians, social issues, climate change(unless specifically within the context of impact to energy or similar), how you feel about a particular news organization's potential biases, etc.  If it's not in the first list it's probably not investing related.  Making comments pertaining to non investment related politics only serves to drive the conversation off course and create a thread that is indistinguishable from one in a political subreddit.  Driving conversation off topic in high level comments by bringing up politics in unrelated threads also falls in this category.  

**Effort:** no shitposts.  If you're not conveying a thought or analysis of a particular subject then it's probably best to not post.  Furthermore top level comments like ""fuck my portfolio"" don't help keeping conversation on track.  Lastly and most importantly anything that falls in to the political meme universe isn't going to fly here.  That means if you're repeating something like TDS, MAGA, trade wars are good and easy to win, Pocahontas, orange man bad, any of the millions of nicknames for the president, very stable genius, any given childish spin on Democrat/republican(ex DemocRAT or Republitard), etc isn't tolerated.  These sorts of things only serve to agitate those on the opposite end of the political spectrum and create partisan arguments.

Your post should be something like ""I disagree/agree with Trump here because [policy] will do XYZ which is good/bad for ABC and blah blah blah blah"".  If you are unable to express an investment related position on a topic without insults and memes then you probably should just go to a political subreddit and comment there.

Special note here: conspiracy theories about politics and markets are not allowed.  If you are going to imply criminal market manipulation or insider trading proof in the form of reporting or other documentation is necessary.  This is not a place for baseless accusations derived from political leaning. 

**Civility:** so we already don't allow personal attacks here.  Generally speaking many people identify so closely with political parties and politicians that they react to political attacks the same way they will to personal attacks.  I get it, people get worked up over politics.  Translating that emotion to a post here only serves to have people with opposing views get similarly worked up.  This isn't an appropriate subreddit for that.  We're here to discuss investing.  So any comment that would violate our personal attacks rule if you made it towards another user is prohibited against political parties or figures.  /r/investing is not a platform for people to express their outrage towards politicians or political parties.  There are tons of subreddits for that sort of thing. 

So now that the guidelines are made clear, here's the consequences.  In our observation the vast majority of people engaging in political attacks and low effort posts are not regular contributors.  They tend to frequent political subreddits and engage in political attacks elsewhere.  So we're automatically handing out 30 day bans for violation of the above rules.  If you feel like your ban was in error or unfair you can appeal in modmail but we're not really inclined to reverse decisions if you aren't already a regular contributor.  For egregious offenses the ban may be 60 days or permanent.  For overt racism, death threats against any public figure, or similar there is an automatic permanent ban.   

**Now Corporate vs Investment News**

/u/crasymike did an awesome job laying out the general guidelines here: https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/b3ss3q/topics_being_removed_corporate_news_vs_investor/

I'm going to just copy some of the hard guidelines here so they're in the same place but take a look at that thread to see a full explanation.

tl;dr Not all corporate news is investment news. If you post a topic the onus is on you to guide the discussion towards investing. If the moderators feel that a topic lacks relevance (which is more clearly defined below) then it might be removed. Off-topic top-level comments have similar standards applied to them.

This means that the onus is on you as the person posting the topic to guide the discussion. As moderators all we can do is remove offending comments, but we can't incite relevant discussion in every topic.

Tell us, why is this political news impactful? Seek out an article that discusses market impacts rather than a generic article. If you want to post corporate news then find an article that includes the impact on the investment. Copy that information into the body of your post. Include price history. Add other pertinent links or details for the corporate.

If you include no relevant investing information then don't be surprised if the topic is completely derailed from discussing investing. If you are posting a topic you need to invite people to talk about investing by using an article, or including information, that is pertinent to investors.

As moderators, we have a few policies that we use to guide ourselves. This is a broad rule that requires some interpretation, but here we go:

* If we can't figure out how your topic relates to investing, and the article doesn't include any (or extremely little) market news, and the body of your post doesn't link the topic to investing we will probably remove it as off-topic.

*  If your topic has an indirect relation to investing (such as being about a public company, or is major market shifting news) but you included no market information and the article(s) you linked have no investing information we may remove it if we feel that there is no clear reason to expect on-topic comments.

* If someone posts a top-level comment on a thread that completely derails away from investing we will probably remove it.

**If the policies above would result in the modteam seemingly needing to remove nearly every top level comment in a thread, and we felt like your thread is ""borderline"" not investing news, then we will take this as confirmation that the topic wasn't investing news.  If the entire conversation in a thread is already driven off topic by political attacks or off topic discussion we will lock and remove a thread no matter how topical it is.  Please do your part and downvote/report political attacks even if you agree with them.  This will prevent us from just nuking a thread**"

2020-04-02,hasbs,5437,My Broker (Questrade) called the police on me after I refused to take down posts criticizing them,"This is kind of part 3 of what's been happening so here are some links to the first 2 posts as well as a link to the original post on WSB about this story:

Original post - 
[My broker (Questrade) wants me to sign an NDA saying I won't talk shit about them after offering me $1200 USD as compensation for losing $50000 from outages](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/frz0fp/my_broker_questrade_wants_me_to_sign_an_nda/) 

Post #2 - [Questrade Legal Contacted me](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fsnubq/contacted_by_questrade_legal_team_for_permission/)

Post #3 (Original post on WSB)- [Got a call from police regarding ""threats"" to Questrade last night... I was read some of the posts you guys made on their sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ft80y4/got_a_call_from_police_regarding_threats_to/)


So in the original email where they mention legal action they accused me of threats, extortion and defamation.

>""We ask that you remove these posts immediately and you cease to use social media to post defamatory and misleading statements about Questrade in an attempt to extort funds from the company. If you do not remove these posts, you are put on notice that this will become a legal matter. Our legal department are already investigating two prior posts you made where you stated that you were ready to ""burn down the building"" as well as making the following statement: “ if I can’t get my money back I’ll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can.''""

Obviously the quotes in the email don't provide full context but the cops understood that and read it back to me. 

Paraphrasing here but this is the comment regarding burning down the building: 

>What is going on with Questrade support? This is such a joke. It pretty much feels like all they're saying is ""too bad so sad"" and ""fuck you"". Honestly getting tired with this.. I feel like I'm going crazy... getting ready to burn down the building. What a joke

So obviously I was saying it as a figure of speech in a time of frustration and not serious in anyway regarding it but regardless Questrade took it to the police. 

The other comment about ""if I can't get my money back I'll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can"" was meant as in them losing potential/current client's commissions. Obviously I didn't mean any harm which I clarified in my reply to the original email. 

Basically the police cautioned me and said they don't think I was serious. 

The call I got was around 1:30am EST and I asked if they usually call this late and the officer said that they were just getting to it cause they had more pressing matters (assuming COVID19). 

Just a waste of police resources in general if you ask me. Especially during this time. Like the guy from the TradeDesk said to me in an email...

>""To keep things in perspective, the world is reeling from a tragic situation.  Thousands of people have lost their lives.  Our staff have been working around the clock to help our clients get through this unprecedented crisis.  In response to our genuine attempts to find an amicable solution, you have threatened and insulted our staff.  I urge you to think about your actions.""

I would urge Questrade to think about their actions. 

The officer also asked me if I was the one writing posts about ""Questrade killing someone's wife""(?) and I think something about Hitler but I was able to clarify that it wasn't me writing those posts and it was other people who were likely upset. 

Just find it pretty ridiculous that police had to waste their time going through screenshots sent by Questrade of their sub... 

Not sure why they would waste the police's time with this but it ultimately resulted in nothing. It was, in my opinion, obvious that those comments were both said out of frustration and I removed them (along with all comments) at the request of a Questrade employee as well anyway. 


I think what people should take away from this though is how poorly Questrade is treating its clients. If I were to phone them and be upset I don't want to be scared of potentially having a criminal charge brought forward on me because they took something I said out of frustration seriously and involved the police. Honestly think their handling of this matter has been incredibly unprofessional throughout. Upsetting to think this was a company I used to admire and recommend to countless people. 

Even just a few days before all this happened I was recommending them to friends - https://imgur.com/a/DHVOHhE

It's amazing to me how poorly they've handled all this and how in less than 3 weeks my opinion of them has done a complete 180. 

What a joke.


I'm sure you guys worked this out for yourselves but just want to point out how it's weirdly convenient that they saw the ""threats"" last week but the police only contacted me after I refused to take down my posts about them... (15 hours after the deadline Questrade gave me to take down the posts) 

Proof I was contacted by police since some people think I am lying about it- https://imgur.com/a/rVU3KfR

________________________________________________

Guys if you want to help get the word out and potentially save other Canadians from signing up with this nightmare of a broker **please tweet this thread at Questrade or Business Insider or marketwatch or bloomberg or anyone else that can write about it.** I don't have an active twitter account so can't really do it myself but would appreciate it immensely.


I think it's important for Canadians to know that they could potentially get contacted by the police if they say something to their broker out of frustration or anger. 

People should know what kind of company they are dealing with. 

You can also email the News Tips email on sites with links to these threads if you want. 


Thanks guys.

______________________________

Edit 2: To those saying I'm in the wrong. I can agree that I shouldn't have said some things but what I want to point out is this

I understand that but if they were worried about the threat why did they wait until after my second round of postings to bring it up?

Why wasn't I contacted by police sooner regarding it.

How is it that police only contacted me about 15 hours after the deadline they gave me to take down my posts had passed?

If there was a concern of safety they had screenshots of the posts Thursday March 26 at 5:53 pm EST at the latest.

How is it police only contacted me April 1st at 1:16AM EST?

13 hours and 16 minutes after the deadline had passed.

Police also had screenshots of posts made on Mar 30 and Mar 31.

Obviously I can't know but it seems like they only went to the police after I refused to take down the posts.

Here's a more clear timeline:

Step 1 - lose money

Step 2 - post about it on /r/Questrade (and only /r/Questrade) on every single post and warn people 

Step 3 - mod on /r/Questrade asks for my number

Step 4 - TradeDeskGuy calls me to talk to me 

Step 5 - TradeDeskGuy says he's gonna see what kind of compensation he can get me

Step 6 - TradeDeskGuy asks me to remove my posts while he is ""going to bat for me"" (no joke he really said that)

>While I review your complaint below  can you do me a solid and remove repetitive posts on wherever you posted online. You can keep your original complaint if you wish. Your entitled to vent your frustration but there are limits to that. We have thousands upon thousands of happy clients which you were probably one of prior to the outages and you spamming the boards is giving your bias.  It is not a fair representation of Questrade nor does it help when I go to bat for you. 

>I was told you already apologized to those responsible for responding to social posts  so I thank you for that.  

>Thanks

Step 7 - I comply and delete even my original complaint

Step 8 - Receive 1200USD offer 

Step 9 - Decline offer and post about what happened everywhere I can think of

Step 10 - Get asked to remove my posts again (by TradeDeskGuy):

>I have just been notified that you have posted information from our private discussions on Reddit.  These discussions were confidential and constituted good faith attempt to resolve your complaint. Your Reddit posts are inaccurate, misleading and contain defamatory content. As we discussed, you incurred a loss as a result of trading in high risk options, which you failed to mention in your posts.

>We ask that you remove these posts immediately and you cease to use social media to post defamatory and misleading statements about Questrade in an attempt to extort funds from the company. If you do not remove these posts, you are put on notice that this will become a legal matter. Our legal department are already investigating two prior posts you made where you stated that you were ready to ""burn down the building"" as well as making the following statement: “ if I can’t get my money back I’ll be sure they lose an equal amount in whatever way I can.'' 

>If we do not receive your confirmation by 12pm on March 31, 2020, that you will discontinue posting defamatory content on social media, you will leave us no choice than to commence legal action. 

>To keep things in perspective, the world is reeling from a tragic situation.  Thousands of people have lost their lives.  Our staff have been working around the clock to help our clients get through this unprecedented crisis.  In response to our genuine attempts to find an amicable solution, you have threatened and insulted our staff.  I urge you to think about your actions.

Step 11 - I don't 

Step 12 - Mar 31  12pm passes

Step 13 - 13.5 hours later I get a call from the police regarding the ""threats"" that I had deleted in Step 7

I think Step was the wrong word to use in all this but does that clear up the timeline for you?"

It's a vicious cycle here, landlords who depend on renters who can't pay their rent now will result in landlords not being able to cover their mortgage--and anyone with a service job that is a homeowner that's furloughed/laid off will also likely face default as well.

While I'm not sure if this will ""dwarf '08"", there most certainly has to be major action taken to prevent even something that's half as bad as '08."

But basically wondering if the ratios for debt to GDP/federal revenue to debt in the next few years could potentially lead to a collapse of the dollar and the global financial system. 

In a nutshell, we are injecting $2 trillion into the economy, and potentially a $4 trillion more if Trump gets his way.  I haven't run the numbers in detail (forgive any errors), but in 2008 the US was sitting at 60% debt to GDP ratio and $9 trillion of debt. Last year, we had a deficit of $1.1 trillion despite our low 3.3% unemployment and record stock market. Debt is now $22 trillion, and GDP to debt is 105%, and federal revenue to debt ratio will skyrocket as tax revenues plummet in the coming years due to coronavirus, mass unemployment, and the closure of small businesses.

In a few years, could investors lose faith in purchasing US government debt?  Would interest rates need to be raised to 10%? Are we looking at a Greece scenario with the US dollar, i.e. hyperinflation, austerity, and currency collapse?  

Are we fucked?"

**Biotechnology in the COVID-19 Crisis Environment – “We are our worst enemy” Theory**

Hi all, I’m a neurology resident physician with a masters degree in molecular biology with a bit of extra time for the moment so wanted to share some personal opinions on areas that COVID-19 might push us towards.

Overall I believe the markets are emotional AF and are panicking currently out of line with reality. Panic looks for a cure, so having some insight into where that ‘cure’ might come from may be highly profitable to some.

**Thoughts On COVID-19**

For some reference and to possibly assuage your fears that the world is ending; as of 4/1, there are a reported 45,000 deaths worldwide related to this new virus. Worldwide, the #4 cause of death is a lower respiratory infection, accounting for 2,957,000 deaths/year (Not including #10, tuberculosis at 1,293,000)\^1. As a factor of mortality, COVID-19 should not be too scary to the average person (You’re still more likely to die from driving to work than from COVID-19, so staying at home really is saving lives!).\^2

This is not to say you should not be taking precautions. All of medicine is predicated on a cost versus benefit calculation. The benefit of being alive, versus the current cost being social distancing and hand washing. An easy calculation for most I hope.

My basic overall model for the future is underlined by the thought that we will not get rid of COVID-19. After this initial wave, we will continue to be hit with pockets of virus off and on. The virus itself will bounce up and down in years to come becoming part of our usual environmental anti-biome. A vaccine will eventually come around to synchronize with herd immunity and depress the virus to levels that people will return to their usual activity levels and every few years we’ll hear about a COVID-19 outbreak. Using this as a theoretically realistic model of what to expect, below are my thoughts on companies that may interface with this virus long term.

**First the Science-y stuff on COVID-19 that guides my assumptions (Simplified/Skippable)**

**Death by Cytokine Storm**

Though this virus is ‘new’, coronaviruses and similar viruses have existed for a very long time. Other subtypes of it are known as the common cold. We are almost all exposed to it in childhood without many hiccups. Similar to how many kids seem to be exposed to COVID-19 but don’t seem to be suffering nearly as much as adults.

This is likely because children’s bodies are trained to see new viruses and react to them in measured ways (Their immune system is tilted towards a **T-cell response**, which takes longer to respond, but responds in subtle ways to slowly tilt the battle against an intruder).

Imagine the T-cell(child) response as a coordinated intelligence program that takes time to learn about a threat and find a precise way target and kill it. It takes time in comparison to our **adult (B-cell) response** (why kids can be sicker for longer versus adult ‘day colds’).

The **B cell (adult)** response is like we kept all the intelligence information we got as a kid and kept the bombs, but fired the intelligence personnel. Why should we pay (calories) to you T-cell people if you’ve already figured out all the targets our body will need to fight in this life? So the T-cell producing organs shrivel as we get older and our immune system is mainly predicated on our B cells response.

But now, we’re exposed to a new virus. Our body turns to the old plans and bombs. The bombs fall, but the targets aren’t right. We hit some virus, we hit some of our cells, collateral damage may be more dangerous than the virus but the body doesn’t know that. We try to rehire old intelligence personnel to try to get them to figure out this new thing attacking us. As we await the hiring process, our body continues to drop bombs trying to destroy everything that might be infected, without knowing what the infection looks like. Eventually, our response is too much, we just dropped bombs on what is ostensibly \~80% of our own lung tissue and now we need a ventilator but there isn’t one available, so we 'suffocate' and die. The virus didn’t kill us, we did it to ourselves. In a storm of rebellion against an invader, we triggered a **cytokine storm\^5** and burned down the whole building to keep the virus from getting in. The B cells had one job, kill virus. Well the virus can’t survive in a corpse for long. Mission accomplished.\^3

(If you’re interested in this model, read about IRIS in HIV/IADS patient for an analogy. To put it simply, when we fix peoples immune systems they can die due to said immune system.)\^4

There is a growing bed of literature concerned about the role of **cytokine storms** in mortalitiy issues ie; this is the thing that kills people. This is the thing we can save people with if its prevented, below is some discussion on options to prevent it. \^5

Viruses in general, are not that prone to innately killing people. They want to keep you alive so they can reproduce more. Unfortunately, our immune responses to viruses can likely be more of an enemy than the virus itself. The biggest thing we want to prevent is death, so with the goal of reducing said endpoint of death, this are my thought on current treatment options and future avenues that could financially benefit.

The thoughts below are from my education in medicine and molecular biology and what I’ve seen from treating COVID-19 patients.

**General Medical Algorithm in treating any contagion:**

1. Prevent it. (Failed)
2. Mitigate it/Prevent Spread (Failing/Ongoing- Role for HCQ and Antivirals/remdisivr)
3. Treat it/Decrease Mortality. (Role for IVIG + Tocilizumab/Sarlimumab)
4. Cure it. (Vaccine)

I think we are ripely between #2 and #3 currently and the next big spike in equities will be in companies positioned to leverage #3. #4 unfortunately is too unpredictable at this point for me to comment on.

**Interface of treatments and finance options:**

More + = Greater Reward/Risk considerations.

(+/-) *Ventilators* (BDX, Phillips, etc) : Short term, essential to limit mortality. As COVD-19 hits hospitals hardest, it will drive up need for ventilators massively (already seen). Outside of the lethality of the virus, the biggest threat to mortality is a lack of ventilators. Initial demand will greatly increase. Unfortunately, once made, ventilators will likely remain long after this virus, depressing the market long term. As we get better treatments that work, ventilators will likely be needed less. Currently all we really have that we know helps is the throw someone on a ventilator and let their immune system kill the thing while we support them.

Short term outlook (<6 months) Positive.

1-2 year outlook: Neutral.

(-) *Hydroxychloroquine*: It doesn’t work as a treatment in my opinion. It is a classic petri-dish versus human problem. It stops/reduces cell virus entry, which is great if you use it as a prophylactic as it will increase the required viral load needed to become infected. As a treatment though, when you have 50,00,000 copies of virus already, reducing the spread isn’t the same as treatment. I believe unfortunately by the time the virus is showing symptoms, a person has too many copies of virus so slowing the rate of repeat cell entry does not make a clinical difference. A few papers have now shown this but not in statistically reliable ways (Not enough patients, an expected limitation at this point). The closest analogue to this is amantadine with its prevention of the flu (which also, doesn’t really work because by the time you have symptoms the virus has spread too much to be clinically blunted). Also the theory behind it is founded on a laboratory model that cannot be necessarily safely replicated (due to dosages) in humans. Would you rather die from COVID-19 or from HCQ overdose stopping your heart?

Overall: cheap medication with limited clinical benefit. Most upside has already been unraveled, greater risk than reward at this point in my opinion.

(+) *Antivirals (Gilead*): Possible area of research, but generalized research into antivirals as a broad class leave a lot to be desired. Used in combination with other medicines target other mechanisms of action they seem to work (HIV treatments) but in isolation they limit reproduction of virus. At >50,000,000 copies the damage might be done though. The thought is the same to “flattening the curve” / slowing down virus replication to give your body time to fight it off. I think this will be an adjunct to treatment long term but given production constraints of remdisivir I don’t think the swing will be that large. (/”priced in” at this point)

Overall: expensive medication with possible clinical benefit. Long term will add to Gileads portfolio but seems somewhat ‘priced in’ at this point. Speculative play against COVID19 only.

(++) *Tocilizumab (Chugai, La Roche/RHHBY*): An IL-6 blocker, one of the important co-factors in the **cytokine storm**. This is something cells release to tell the body to ‘release the bombs’. I’m hopeful for this as a treatment. If we go back to the original hypothesis, the bodies response to a ‘new invader’ is a large part of what causes the end point of death. Multiple studies have now launched across countries as this seems to be clinically effective. Limiting its potential upside is the fact that it’s immunosuppressive and we don’t have a lot of long term data on how COVID-19 interacts with immunosuppressed people. Personally I’m very bullish on this.

Overall: expensive medication with likely clinical benefit. Will likely become a key part of long term management of this disease as it will target the mortality causing part of the disease. Limited background market outside COVID19.

(++) *Sarlimumab* (Sanofi/SNY, Regeneron/REGN): Similar to tocilizumab, also an IL-6 blocker.

Overall: expensive medication with likely clinical benefit.

(++++) *IVIG* (Grifols/GRFS, CSL Behring AG/CSLLY, Baxter/BAX): This is other peoples plasma. Like vaccinating someone else, pulling out the antibodies they made against the virus, and injecting them into someone else. Targeted treatment that also blunts peoples own inflammatory response, limiting the effect of a **cytokine storm**. It is used as an immune-modulatory agent (not immunosuppressive) at baseline and has a good market for multiple sclerosis and other autoimmune disorders that 'flair'. The theory being that injecting other peoples premade antibodies to the virus will kill the virus in a targeted way while also mitigating the immune reaction and keeping your body from killing itself. Personally I’m extremely bullish on this and Grifols in particular as that is the product most hospitals seem to use around my area. CSL Behring also has a reported subcutaneous formulation which could keep people out of the hospital for infusions, limiting exposure/spread of virus as well.

Overall: Expensive medication, already in shortage (increased demand/decreased production over the past few years) prior to this, with limited companies able to produce it. Likely to have a large clinical benefit and become a mainstay of treatment prior to more directed therapies/vaccines. Has a baseline market (other disorders) that will only increase in the background long term. Safety of a stable market/demand with upside as a massive treatment for COVID-19.

(++++) Vaccine: A vaccine is the ultimate treatment, unfortunately there’s no way to pick which company will be most successful. I expect the first vaccines to not be very effective and will unfortunately likely give the virus an opportunity to morph. All this to say, picking a vaccine company is impossible at this point with the available literature base currently. You could try to assemble all of the companies working on a vaccine that have a separately good pipeline to try to play the eventual massive swing when a vaccine is announced and limit downside when it’s not the company you picked.

(--) Hospitals in general: Will be hit fairly hard, most reimbursement for hospitals comes from elective procedures, self funded payment or payed with private insurance. COVID19 represents a glut of patients that are likely to not be able to pay, being shoved into expensive ICUs that the hospital will have to front unfortunately. On top of this are costs to retrofit hospitals for the increased burden. At the same time hospitals are needed to hire more people, cover shifts, and go without their main source of income dependent on a low government reimbursement rate. (Almost any US hospital would go under if it depended only on government reimbursement as of this moment so there is a very real risk to hospitals.)

From a financial standpoint, I think the IVIG market stands to benefit the most from all this long term with the least amount of initial risk though the research is still lacking in the field. This is the closest to a crystal ball prediction that I have given my education and experience with these patients.

Overall, things will hurt, in the short term and in a human term. People who could have been alive given proper government action will not be by years end regrettably. As it has though, the global markets will continue in their indifferent churning ways and in the end we will be preparing for the next downturn. We have gotten past many different pandemics before.

In the end, this too shall pass.

Also, thank you to all those that are washing their hands and trying their best to self isolate. I know it's a massive pain but it really is saving lives."

2020-04-03,noentic,14,Buying Deep ITM LEAPS on stocks you want to own long term . A pro method to leveraging you capital during this down swing,"Let's say I have $15,000 and I want to own 100 shares of MSFT and it's currently trading at $150.

To own 100 shares out right, I can pay $15,000. Or, I can buy a deep ITM Leap call - say January 21 '22 at $80 strike for $72 premium. The delta on these leaps are approximately 1, and the theta is close to 0. I lose two points out right on the premium, but I am also able to control twice as many shares for cost of buying 100 outright.

&#x200B;

Advantages to this - it's essentially a cheap way to leverage. Also, due to the long expiration date, even if the stock fell to $80 (incredibly unlikely in MSFTs case - and I'd only do this with stocks that are very unlikely to fall to your strike price) the premium will still be somewhat preserved as delta decreases from one but theta will increase at this time because it's no longer so far ITM - however this buffer decreases as it nears the expiration date.

Disadvantages - You lose out on dividends. You could theoretically exercise the options on the ex div date to avoid that but would have to wager if it's worth the cost to continually pay the extra premium for buying the deep ITM call.

&#x200B;

Neutral - you can leverage yourself to the tits. If you are right, enjoy your significant gains. If you are wrong, you can easily blow your account up. Don't go all in on one stock and diversify. Also, average down."

2020-04-03,Apacheone,18,SBA 7a (forgiveable) loan to small businesses - Frantic Confusion,"I wanted to make a short post about the CARE act and what's actually happening on the ground. I'm a lifelong entrepreneur, and I own about 10 small businesses (of varying size).

Background: This last week has been a total clusterfuck of business owners trying to figure out the details of the SBA 7a loans. The entire week has been information overload. I probably have 250 emails in my inbox with conflicting information about the process to receive a loan, and the requirements for forgiveness. Everyone has been told that applications will be available to submit by tomorrow (Friday) through your banker.

Current Situation: The banks obviously have no clue what's going on. Here is a quote from one of the local banks in my area written and sent out today: ""As it stands now, banks are being publicly called on to deliver a program where many of the most basic questions about it, including the terms and conditions under which the loans will be approved, and lenders' liability for the loans, have not yet been fully addressed. This leaves individual lenders unable to decide the parameters of their participation in the program"".

NOBODY believes that 350 billion is enough to fund all of the loans necessary to small business across the country. This was confirmed today from the call I received from my BofA rep. He told me that he just had a call with management, and BofA is going to prioritize those with the largest credit lines to be first in line. Obviously this works out well for BofA. He also said he didn't think there would be enough money to fund any CARE act forgivable loans for my companies (ouch). As you can imagine, business owners are frantic trying to be first in line for this free money grab. They're about to find out it's not necessarily first come, first serve.

The banks are going to charge origination fees from 5-14% on each government loan. I've heard they're non-refundable, although that last part has not been confirmed.

Each of my companies are in a different position due to the coronavirus. Some had revenues of tens of millions go down to almost zero. Others are down 20%, and a couple are doing better than ever. It's very difficult to make strategic decisions on what to do with employees and cash when there is so much uncertainty.

Please don't take any of this as a complaint. I just wanted to share as much as I could about what's going on for entrepreneurs right now. Ask any questions."

2020-04-02,AloneForever,54,Reasons why markets aren't falling farther,"Some of you might be as perplexed as I am as to why the markets didn't fall farther, and why we saw that recent huge rally. I was holding some puts in anticipation of a bigger drop, and they lost about 90% of their value over 2 weeks (I've since cut my losses).

Let's collect and list some of the reasons why markets aren't continuing to fall. I there's something missing, comment and I'll add it to the list. Here's the list:

* There's an expectation of a speedy recovery
* We only have 2 months to go until the shutdown ends (according to [this model which projects April 15 as the peak](https://covid19.healthdata.org/)), assuming the shutdown remaining in place through May
* Bailout bill is large enough to keep businesses afloat for the next month, maybe two
* The recently unemployed are mostly service industry people who will be hired back quickly once businesses reopen
* Oil price war may be over soon
* Tons and tons of cash has been sitting on the sidelines waiting for a good time to buy, now it's flooding into stocks
* The Fed's QE program means it's a good time for large funds to rotate out of bonds into stocks
* ETFs are the preferred investment vehicle for most people through their 401k or IRAs, and people are trying to ""buy the dip"" or just buying on autopilot
* Automatic rebalancing from balanced funds and roboadvisors
* Liquidity lifeline for banks and hedge funds and relaxed reserve requirements means fewer margin calls, less selling pressure
* Big funds, HFTs, and maybe even some MMs are waiting on the sidelines for things to settle down (which might be why volume dropped a bit recently after a huge surge)
* There isn't enough economic data yet
* Earnings reports haven't come out yet
* Market already dropped 37% from high to low
* Global liquidity crisis means all central banks are printing money which buoys the US dollar, allowing the Fed to print more money with limited inflation

My thoughts: I expected markets to drop another 30-40% a couple weeks ago, but instead we saw a big 20% jump. I'm still skeptical of the current situation, but if the virus growth continues to slow we might see that V recovery after all. I'm holding some bonds and a few call LEAPs for QQQ (tech will do well no matter how things go, IMO) and USO, as well as October VIX puts. I'm considering buying some RUT puts 3-6 months out to hedge against another big drop."

The class B shares have 10 votes, the class A shares, which are the ADRs, have 1.  90% of the voting power is represented by the class B shares, which are owned by the founders (and maybe a handful of others).

I see it as possible, maybe even probable, that they use the cash on the balance sheet ($1.6B) to buy in the float.  The float is only worth $500M at these prices.

They would take the company private.

And then just use the rest of the cash on the balance sheet to fend off all the coming class action lawsuits.

[This wouldn't be the first time a Chinese company went public, then engaged in a ""go private"" transaction using their voting power of the share class structure to pay only a tiny premium on their public shares, and then reissues equity on the Chinese exchanges, in another public offering.

So we've got another move towards a new oil deal in light of recent market turmoil.  Saudi Arabia was the last major hold out and apparently they [cited Russian opposition](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-saudi-russia/saudi-wants-cooperation-to-bolster-oil-blames-russia-for-turmoil-gulf-source-idUSL4N2BQ0U7) to cuts as their primary reason for holding out.

Source: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec-russia/russia-has-no-plans-to-increase-oil-output-energy-minister-idUSKBN21K1DC

There has yet to be a formal meeting scheduled and the exact role of the US in all of this has yet to be determined but it does appear we're at least past the posturing at this point and could potentially see the Saudis and UAE backing off their prior promises to increase production at least temporarily here while as a sign of good faith during negotiations similar to what the Russians have just stated.  Bear in the mind there's a deep drop in demand in the oil market currently and we'll likely still see inventories building even with some cuts but it should buy some time during Q2 here for the virus to run its course and demand to somewhat normalize again."

2020-04-02,WolfOfWoolStreet,30,Short term Covid Recession or long term corporate-debt Depression?," 

TLDR apologies, I might've been trapped inside for too long but...

I keep hearing on most media and among us retailers that the state of the wider economy will be bad for now but that the economy is much stronger than 2008 and the previous recession and we should get a quicker V shaped recovery. I'm confused by this narrative...

Global debt has nearly risen two-fold, it is now 85% higher in 2019 than 2008, as we have tried to pump up deflating economies. Inflation has stagnated, asset prices have ballooned way above wages and real-wage growth has reversed and has now been declining since 2015. At the same time we've seen incredible stock market growth, some 120% on the S&P in the decade 2010-20, in my limited understanding in part due to attempted inflationary monetary policy like QE etc.

That lending increase since 2008 ,on the back of very low interest rates and next to no inflation, means it's very easy for large caps in particular to leverage to the sky. So the 2008 mortgage backed debt default warning seems to me to have gone largely ignored. Many companies of all sizes look ripe for bankruptcy due to pretty tenuous balance sheets after lots of spending on buybacks, lack of investment in growth and lack of protection against demand or supply shocks (like this one right now).

Ray Dalio (big fan) has been pointing out for years we are due a massive correction as part of a long running debt cycle and we should see a crisis the like of the great depression, drawing many parallels with the 1920-30's global geopolitical atmosphere and today. I would highly encourage delving into one of his longer interviews or one of his books on the crises (below) where he explains the historical and macro economic precedent and the reasoning he uses.

2018 interview explaining economic theory of the idea in which he predicts a lot of the corporate debt issues that are slowly coming out right now: [https://youtu.be/5C43i3yclec](https://youtu.be/5C43i3yclec)

link to his free open source book on the possible crisis: [https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/Principles-For-Navigating-Big-Debt-Crises-By-Ray-Dalio.pdf](https://www.bridgewater.com/big-debt-crises/Principles-For-Navigating-Big-Debt-Crises-By-Ray-Dalio.pdf)

The Covid affects might be comparatively limited but the wider economic indicators are not so bullish and IMHO are not being talked about anywhere near as much as they should. I can't help but feel we're not headed for a 30-40% two quarter recession but that cyclical depression which could reset some of the global economic foundations and concurrently cause much greater market pain than many of us are thinking which will last not 6 months to 2 years but far far longer. The Dow took 29 years to reach it's previous high after the great depression (5100 points, 1929-58).

Thanks for the long read, please poke holes/ proffer solutions in the economic theory of the thing. I await any thoughts with much curiosity if you made it this far..."

2020-04-03,ACMCapital,3,We Are Entering A New GFC: Analysis on the Coming Months,"Hi All,

I'm new to r/investing but not new to investing itself - I work at a boutique investment firm. I thought I would come here to offer some of my thoughts on the current economic climate. I appreciate any feedback or comments greatly. 

**1.** As someone mentioned in a previous post, referencing a Bloomberg article, it seems highly likely that mortgage default rates will skyrocket to the 10-15% level, much like the previous GFC of 08-9. While this means that millions of people will be effectively homeless, it also has drastic effects for the economy. As we saw in 08-9, the high default rates mean that banks sell the claimed houses to 'make good' on the loan. This increased selling drives the prices of houses down, which might allow for people to re-enter the market, except for the fact that banks are no longer lending after taking significant losses. What this does is open up a potential area for profit for the investor. While we are most likely unable to buy credit default swaps on mortgage backed securities, called 'bespoke tranche opportunity' by some banks, we can borrow shares to sell at lower prices or simply short bank stock CFDs. Bank stocks sold of by 40% and more during the GFC when it became clear that they did not have a handle on the current market, and it seems clear that this may happen once again.   


**2.** The oil and commodity market is a particular focus of our firm, and I have been given permission to provide analysis on the current sentiment, providing I do not tell our positions or sizings. The WTI oil price has crashed through the floor due to increased production from Russia, compounded by the decreased demand due to COVID-19. This is a time of great uncertainty in the oil markets, with high volatility. However, the current price war is pretty much destined to stop, as both the economies of Russia and the Middle Eastern countries strongly depend on the oil price. Other countries such as Kazakhstan are almost entirely oil based. This means that the price war benefits no one, and both countries would be fit to agree upon production amounts, separate to OPEC recommendations. This means that it can be expected that the oil price returns to the $30 level within the next 4-6 months, and it will most likely stay there for the following year, as everything comes back online and a trade agreement is negotiated."

2020-04-02,MasterCookSwag,61,JPMorgan 2020 2nd quarter guide to the markets.,"So I don't normally post these because I think most people are following it to begin with but with the influx of new posters I figured I'd throw it up. 

A few key things I thought were interesting. 

- Value factor was the second worst performing factor in the first quarter, had the second highest volatility, and continues to underperformed over the last 15 years.  The space is increasingly crowded and has seemingly been arbed out so much that value now has negative premium. 

- momentum once again is a top performer both in volatility, drawdown, and annualized returns. 

- In the last 40 years there has only been four that experienced an intra- year drop of 34% or more.  87, 02, 08, and 20, of those only 1987 ended with positive YOY returns. 

- Despite common rhetoric household debt service ratio is at 9.7% and has sustained lower levels than any other point since 1980.

- YTD all asset classes are negative outside of Treasuries and MBS and some PMs.  Treasuries are the best performer with average return of 8.2%.  (Thanks MCS for constantly telling us treasuries are the best diversification for a retail investor!!) 

- with precipitous declines in international equities the United States now accounts for 57% of the world's market cap. 

- Dividends made up a smaller portion of overall return that almost any other decade in history - likely due to share buybacks becoming a preferred method to distribute capital. 

- Large cap US and REITS finally dethrone Emerging Markets as the highest returning asset classes over the last 15 years.

There's a whole bunch of other shit in there.  Give it a lookie.

It is funny to hear everyone’s thoughts between family, friends, coworkers, etc.  Some praise tech (like myself), however while I still think it’s an excellent buying opportunity for the industry, tech hasn’t really been crushed like many others by this. Many say how the airlines and cruise lines are down 70% and are a steal at this price... but surely these industries are going to come out of this incredibly bruised and battered? Some companies or industries will make it through this and rebuild efficiently and I’d love to hear everyone’s top picks.

2020-04-02,beerion,10,"Merger Question: UTX & RTN - uhh, free money?","Edit: See comment chain. I didn't realize they started trading ticker UTX-WI for the aerospace component, only. Glad my put order didn't fill...

Trying to figure out the math:

Per the merger agreement, UTX stock converts 1:1 to the new RTX tomorrow. RTN converts as 1 RTN share into 2.3348 shares of RTX.

**Market Caps:**

UTX = 75.76B

RTN = 33.56B

Combined RTX = 109.3B (UTX + RTN)


**Share counts:**

UTX = 866.16M

RTN = 278.48M

Combined RTX = 1516.4M (UTX + 2.3348×RTN)


**Share price of RTX tomorrow:**

MC/sharecount = 109.3B / 1.5164B shares = $72.07 


Now if 1 share of UTX (currently at $87.47) converts to 1 share of RTX, which should be at $72.07; that represents a loss of 17.5%.

Conversely, RTN (at $120.51 per share) converts to 2.3348 RTX shares at $72.07 (2.3348 × $72.07 = $168.26 of total value captured from each RTN share); that represents a gain of 40% after conversion. 

What am I missing? Feel like this is a no brainer. I tried to buy UTX puts before the close, but it didn't execute. Which is probably for the best bc I'm sure I've got something wrong somewhere...

I do own RTN shares so will be interesting to see what happens tomorrow."

2020-04-03,KeyLook5,1,This has been a humbling experience.,"There are many lessons to draw from this crisis, but for me the main lesson is that we are never truly in control. Everything can come crashing in the blink of an eye. No matter how great the market looks one day, unexpected and uncontrollable things (9/11, 2008, covid-19) can take hold of the wheel and drive you into a ditch. 

Just last month we were debating whether or not we were living in the greatest bull market in history. Now today our government is fighting with every ounce of energy to keep us from a depression. Just a few months ago, media outlets were publishing stories about record breaking consumer confidence rates. Today, we are seeing record breaking unemployment claims and banks are asking whether we'll be trending towards levels of mortgage defaults that can rival what transpired in 2008.

You could have been the most financially responsible person, but depending on how things go you might have to put retirement  off by 5 to 10 years. You may be the hardest working person around, but depending on how things shape up you might be out of a house and job. 

Our country preaches bootstraps and hard work but almost never says anything about luck and fate. We are powerless against nature, and we suffer the consequences of other people's decisions. 

I am truly humbled by this. I will never look at investing, business, and even life the same way. It's all so fragile. 

We are dust in the wind. Control is an illusion. Luck is the ground that we walk on and fate is our master. 

The silver lining is that it should be clear that we are in this life together. When enough of us get hurt, everyone feels the pain. Life is not a zero sum game. We can all live decent lives and we should wish exactly that for one another. 

Never let a crisis go to waste, some like to say. In that same spirit, may this crisis be the calling shot to the power brokers and money elites to start building a different society. One that practices compassion and fairness as a matter of course, not only when the apple cart looks like it's about to tip over."

2020-04-03,cmcdonal2001,0,Short term investment for cashing out,"Hi all,

I just moved an old state pension plan into a personal IRA, about $120k.  My wife has her own retirement fund that's doing well (we actually missed a lot of the recent downturn because she was in the process of switching jobs and most of her retirement was checks in the mail for the worst weeks), we have a rental property that's generating a small amount of passive income and building equity as the property generates some decent gains in value, and my new job will place me into a new state pension plan that I'll be comfortably maxed out on by my late 50s.

The current plan is to liquidate the 120k from my old state pension into a down payment on our dream home, taxes and fees be damned. I know it's not the most financially sensible move but we're happy making a bit of a financial sacrifice if it means we get to be comfortable and happy with where we are from here on out.  My question is: if we're not going to be buying for 6-18 months, where would you park the money?

2020-04-02,TikiB,7,April 2nd Market Analysis - Canadian Names Edition,"Here is my post from [yesterday]( https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/ft7jfl/april_1st_analysis_canadian_edition/).  I want to explain how I make my entries, exits, and reads.  Technical analysis is using chart patterns to determine when to buy and sell.  I used the moving average of a stocks price, its volume, and various indicators to determine the short term price action.  Technical analysis is good as long as there is no new factors (such as trump’s oil comment today).  Here is an example of how it would work with [Kinross Gold]( https://www.tradingview.com/x/0NE6OBFY/).
I use the Bollinger Bands to determine when the price is outside of standard deviation, RSI to determine when a stock is oversold/overbought, moving averages to determine the average price over a time period, FIB retracement to determine the backtest after a bounce.  Had I used all these factors you could have seen to buy in March 13th when it was outside of Bollinger Band and RSI was oversold.  You could have sold at whatever profit you would like.  If you have sold you could have used FIB retracement to get back in at the 61% retracement.
Now it is not a science by any means but it does help with short term trades, which is how I make my entries and exits.  So my analysis of these stocks is based on my read of these charts, so lets get into it.

**Cutting Supply of Oil?** –  Trump said that Saudis have agreed to cut supply of oil.  This caused the price of oil to spike.  Not surprisingly the energy names I have been watching spiked huge.  Crescent Point Energy bounced to 41% up and most were up 15-20%.  After oil pulled back most names pulled back with it.  Crescent Point Energy old quadruple top of $1.19 acted as new support on backtest, Suncor Energy maintains above the 12 hour moving average, CDN Natural Resources maintained its hourly 12 MA as well except it was only up 7%.  I account this difference (20% gains on Cenovus and Crescent Point Energy vs. 7% for Suncor and CDN as laggard plays.  Suncor and CDN bounced huge earlier this week while Cenovus and Crescent did not.)   Russia and Saudi Arabia have said this is a lie.  Oil dropped but then bounced back as the US doubled down. Oil news overnight will dictate movement tomorrow.

**Gold continues the bounce** – I said the other day gold held their retracement test.  Today it continued the bounce and remains in equilibrium.  I would be very surprised that after a 60% retracement if it just bounces straight through and breaks highs of other days.  I would look for gold miners like Kinross, B2gold, Yamana and others to start out strong again tomorrow (maybe 3-5%) before topping out and beginning to pullback to maintain equilibrium.

**Canopy Growth** – still holding strong and I examined why – absolutely no volume.  The volume on the consolidation over past 4 days has been less than 50% of the volume on the bounce.  This favours the bulls.  If SPY begins to bounce, it will test recent highs.  If SPY falls and WEED breaks support, volume may pick up and consolidation will be underway.

**Air Canada** – up 1%, I expect more downside once people realize we are stuck indoors for many more months and their bottom line is affected.  

Bombardier – in a super tight range, at the $0.41-$0.42 range I said yesterday it could be a good bottom fishing play

**Blackberry** – you can try a bottom fishing play of $3.94 if it falls straight to that amount but technical analysis does not work when there is news and lower forecast and growth makes the read much harder."

3. Auto sales numbers are out tomorrow. Bloodbath, maybe to no one's surprise but when you see it on paper, it's still...shocking. 35-50% drop in sales in March for all the big guys. Maybe all priced in, maybe not. March will likely be the worst month on record for the past 20+ years until, you know, April. Investors have to be wondering if even a million cars will move this month. Last year was 17 million and analysts have already downgraded estimates to 13.5 million despite good numbers in Jan and Feb.

4. Last week's unemployment numbers come out tomorrow at 8:30 AM. From this article, it sounds like 4-5 million are expected, so any amount in either direction could swing things. It's hard to imagine it could be less than the 3.5 million reported last week, but we shall see.

5. This last one isn't a statistic, just an opinion, but it *seems* like most of the good news is priced in with the big stimulus package already passed and ""QE Infinity and Beyond"" not having the same ring. I also expect people to take May 1 as the reopening of the country with a bigger grain of salt this time around given the target keeps moving. Perhaps Washington can rustle up some good news (early talks on an infrastructure bill, for example), but they would need to haul ass to keep the markets green to end the week IMO. Appreciate any and all opinions (bring your facts to back it up!). Disclaimer: I don't have puts and I'm already 60% invested, 40% cash."

It appears to have been overly punished by the market in the past month.,"The company's stock fell from c. $22 end of Dec 2019 to $2.21 as of end of normal trading today. Is this not excessive, even against the background of the state of the oil industry? I am aware that various factors might be at play here and I have listed the ones that I am aware of plus my thoughts:

1. **LCCP project overruns (from initial estimated cost of c. $8bn to an expected final cost of c. $13bn** \- the project which has taken 5 years or so to complete is now > 98% complete and will enhance the company's chemicals production capacity, which is the direction management is aiming for long term. The joint-CEOs who dropped the ball as costs overruns occurred already resigned. Is this not a case where the concept of sunk costs come in and be more forward looking?
2. **High debt to equity ratio - c. 65% D/E ratio** \- this borrowing was incurred for the LCCP project primarily and while the oil industry might be in the doldrums at the moment. The asset will probably be fully operational by end of this year, and long term, should enhance their cash flows.
3. **Oil price war (Saudi Arabia/Russia)** \- the stock price dropped from c. $9 pre-price war to c. $2 in the week the Saudi's went all out pumping oil. Is this not ultimately bound to be sorted out once the political points have been made? I reckon it will.

Not the brightest cookie in the jar so I thought I would check on the more knowledgeable investors in this group in case I am being too optimistic or at the worst case, just plain naive.

2020-04-02,street-guru,2,$SHOP - COVID-19 is short-term pain but long-term gain for Shopify:,"Analyst checks confirm lower web traffic volume and higher promotional activity at 20 of Shopify's largest merchants in March. This is obviously a bearish indicator for consumer spending and near-term gross merchandise volume (GMV) trends. SHOP's 1m+ small-medium merchants means it is quite exposed to highly volatile volume trends with the COVID-19 disruptions. 

Another source of pressure may come from the Q1 production shutdown in China, which could impact the many Shopify merchants who drop ship from China for product delivery. This impact is likely to sustain into Q2, not to mention the sharply lower consumer sentiment. Management understandably pulled their 2020 guidance last night.

As still one of the most expensive names in the SaaS, the overhang on SHOP could sustain for a while. But none of this disruption changes the fact that businesses will continue to shift to online. In fact, COVID-19 is accelerating it. Long-term, SHOP still has a very favorable outlook to simplify commerce solutions for the masses. This stock should be bought if/when you're comfortable with its valuation."

One way to improve the situation for Corona patients could potentially be to use so-called convalescent plasma, ie blood plasma from recovered individuals. This plasma contains antibodies to the virus in question and can thus potentially help the affected immune system to fight the disease. The products delivered are part of a project in this area. **The company's product can help increase availability of blood plasma, including convalescent plasma, by removing the blood group barrier.** In addition, potential problems with immune complex formation with, for example, AB plasma (containing soluble AB antigen) can be avoided.

2020-04-02,sanem48,6,How to avoid bail ins?,"Seeing that between 2015 and 2019 most of the world has adopted bail in regulations (that is any deposits over the government insured amount are taken by the bank, anything below that gets frozen for undetermined time period), the risk of bail ins seems likely in the current crisis.

Lebanon is already talking about implementing it:  [https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1kwbrjj7pczrz/lebanon-depositor-bailin-39may-be-the-only-way39-to-save-the-banking-sector](https://www.euromoney.com/article/b1kwbrjj7pczrz/lebanon-depositor-bailin-39may-be-the-only-way39-to-save-the-banking-sector) 

&#x200B;

Of course this would provoke massive protest from the public, however the virus has created a situation that would make a bail in more easy to implement for governments:

\- Banks are closed, meaning people can't go to their local banks and ask for their money.

\- Withdrawal limits have been implemented in a number of countries, from what I hear Germany and US. In countries like Belgium banks are giving conflicting information if large withdrawals are still possible or not.

\- Protests are impossible, as mass gatherings are illegal and highly dangerous for any participators.

\- Police and military have emergency powers, allowing them to put down any protests (for whatever cause) quickly and by any means (that is lethal force).

\- Media blackout, for national security governments will likely block and punish the spreading of any fake news (that is any information that's not government approved for public consumption, regardless if say news of a bank run is true or not).

\- Cash money could be banned, to avoid the risk of virus spreading. This will keep people from taking out their money from the banks cash. The switch to digital payments will also make it easier for governments to control the fallout of a bail in.

\- Financial support for the masses. For example free money handouts, Thailand has already implemented this, I believe Malaysia is looking into it, the US certainly is. This system would allow governments to increase or decrease the income of its population at will. For a millionaire who just had his money taken by the bank $1000 is laughable, but for most people who would lose little in a bank bail in this would be a very generous income, and would offset any losses they might suffer, reducing the risk for them to riot. What is more, they would not want to risk losing this new source of income if they are caught rioting. Another aid being implement globally is to delay bank loan repayments, for most people getting free money and having their loan payments delayed is a huge boon, and they would even prefer this over bail outs (which would benefit the rich, rather than the tax paying masses).

&#x200B;

As such the virus is creating a perfect storm for a bail in scenario: the banks likely are suffering heavy losses; they are by law allowed to confiscate the deposits from their clients; the public can't do much to protest such a move right now; government actions to limit the virus fallout will make take away the will or need for most people to protest the bail ins.

All in all, only a small number of people would greatly suffer from the bail ins (10% would actually lose money), while most of the middle class would be able to survive having their money frozen for a year, and for at least 50% of people it would be a beneficial situation.

&#x200B;

Seeing as this is r/investing where most people actually have money they'd rather invest than have it taken or frozen by the banks, how to avoid the bail ins?

\- Brokerage firms seem like the safest bet, since they have no banking license, and thus have to keep their clients' money separate from any liabilities the company might have. For example in 2008 not a single brokerage firm needed a bail out (except one, because the CEO broke the law and gambled with his customers' money). I did see brokers are now offering to spread their clients money over multiple banks, to benefit from interest rates without breaking the government guaranteed amounts, but I imagine this money could get frozen then.

\- Invest the money on the market. I don't know if assets on a bank trading account would also be bailed in, I think it will, since those shares are technically on the books of the bank, and not in the investor's name (contrary to popular belief).

\- Keep it cash in a safety deposit box. However with banks being closed getting to the box might be tricky, and risky when other people see you go in and come out with a big bag with Dollar signs on it.

\- Gold I think is risky because the banks will likely push down the value if people put their money in it, since banks don't like competition, and they've admitted to manipulation gold prices.

\- Crypto's I think are even more risky because it'll be very easy to make these illegal because they pose a danger to national economic security.

\- Cash might be safest, although many countries will likely ban larger bills, certainly Europe will ban the 500 Euro bills. Australia is looking to make large cash transactions illegal starting this year, likely other countries will do the same."

Summary:

* Updates on markets for 6 weeks and 1 week ending 3/27/2020

* Buybacks in the hot seat: Is there evidence to support the notion that buybacks are evil?

   * Looked at global companies that did buybacks in 2009, how have they faired in 2020? 

   * Damodaran admits up front this is a weak test, but it's a starting point

   * TL;DR: Globally, companies that did buybacks in 2009 saw their market caps drop by 25% in 2020, while companies that did not do buybacks in 2009 saw their market caps drop by 21% in 2020. ""Not a huge difference.""

   * Same test for 2009 dividend payers vs. non-dividend payers. Difference roughly the same.

* US stock buyback vs. debt connection? Is going into deep debt to fund buybacks the real evil?

   * Broke down companies by Debt/EBITDA and buyback vs. no buybacks in 2009.

   * Negative EBITDA (one of the worst case buyback vs. no buyback differentials): 31% vs 24%. ""There, I told you so!""

   * But, the biggest differential came from companies with the lowest Debt/EBITDA, 26% vs. 16%.

   * ""Put simply, there is no strong evidence that ... buybacks by themselves are creating any additional friction."" UAL notwithstanding.

   * This is NOT a complete assessment of the impact of buybacks and dividends. Possibly a topic for a future vlog.

* Focus on the future, adapting the company valuation model for the impact of coronavirus

2020-04-02,eDgYkArlMaRx,1,Apple's Position For The Near Future,"Apple is in a very strange place for future performance. As most people realized, they have inherently more exposure than other tech companies since they sell physical good, and expensive ones none the less. A global recession will undoubtedly push down sales on their top tier models.Before the crisis, they were already seeing declining phone sales, many citing the increase of cost to lack of innovation.

Products: They are set to release the ""iPhone 9"" in mid-April with a starting price of $399 it is next in line for the SE, but that may be pushed back due to Corona Virus. With its low price, it is set the fill the gap of people who want to upgrade from 6 and 7s but didn't due to cost. Like the SE, there is a high chance it will be very popular. Later in the year, they are set to release ""over-ear AirPods,"" a new watch, a new Mac, a much faster MacBook, and the ""iPhone 12."" Wearables have been their fastest-growing segment.

Financials: Although they saw a decline in phone sales, their EPS did not fall in line with it, only falling from 11.91 to 11.87. This is due to their less noticeable increases with other products such as their services and their decreasing operational costs. They are becoming more efficient as a company.

Cash: Apple has an ungodly supply of cash on hand, with almost 80 billion still on the table for their buybacks program, and enough extra to cancel their debt practically twice. This leaves them in a position to buy many new companies and technologies at a discount due to the crisis. They have already purchased the leading weather app and then took it offline from android. They are in an exceptional position to start hoarding technologies that could have been beneficial to their competitors.

Moats: Apple, as a company, is based around its propriety software. If you want any on of their products, you are sucked into the ecosystem of products that work so well in tangent. They also have near-monopolies on many growing segments, such as programming. Most programmers use MacBooks due to their similarities with Linux, and you need them to develop IOS apps. One of their strong suits is their products' co-dependence on each other.

2020-04-01,elongated_smiley,87,Discussion about Dr. Michael Burry's ETF bubble theory,"I recently watched a great ELI5 of the ETF bubble theory proposed by Burry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTzXLIT__6U

This left me with some concerns and questions. 

Like many others, my main strategy for long-term retirement investments is to DCA into [index fund] ETFs. Since my horizon is 20+ years, everything I've read tells me this is the best thing I can do, especially if I don't want to spend much time actively managing my investments.

So understandably Burry's theory has me concerned. What happens in 2050 if my chosen ETF has gone bankrupt, or has seriously underperformed the market (or active funds)?

But is this even a concern if I'm not panic selling during a crash when others are doing the same? If I just buy and hold long term, and sell as needed during retirement, will this bubble theory even affect me?

I'm also left wondering why he focuses on ETFs. What about managed funds? Are they not affected in the same way?

Actually, even after watching the video, I have to admit I don't understand how exactly this is an issue.

Let's say I buy **1** share of an ETF **""ABC""** for **$100** per share. The ETF  contains **100** companies that have share prices of **$1** each. One of these companies is **""DEF""**.

When I buy my **1** share of ETF **""ABC""**, does the ETF not have to go out and purchase **1** share of **""DEF""** (along with 99 other shares)? I thought this was how it was *supposed* to work. Otherwise it reminds me of the banks' loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR) system."

Most individuals would do well to invest most of their wealth in the capital market assets, particularly equities. Most investors, however, consistently make poor investment decisions as a result of a poor theoretical understanding of financial markets as well as cognitive and emotional biases, leading to inferior investment returns and inefficient allocation of capital.

2020-04-01,HugeCanoe,581,Economists Are Losing Hope in a ‘V-Shaped’ Post-Virus Recovery,"The coronavirus is guaranteed to throw the world into recession, but economists are becoming less convinced about the potential for a strong snapback in growth.

The base case for forecasters is that a recovery, perhaps even a vigorous one, gets under way in the second half of 2020. But as the pandemic spreads through Europe and the Americas, and the wide range of knock-on effects comes into clearer view, caveats to that call are piling up.

relates to Economists Are Losing Hope in a ‘V-Shaped’ Post-Virus Recovery Underlying all of them is the simple fact that economic outcomes hinge on something that’s beyond the professional competence of most economists to forecast: the trajectory of the disease itself.

“We have no certainty the virus will be gone by the end of the second quarter,” said Nobel prizewinner Joseph Stiglitz, a professor at Columbia University in New York. If it “lasts through the summer, then all the effects will be amplified.”

Read More: Economists See U.S. Facing Worst-Ever Quarterly Contraction

Beyond that, there is an array of questions for economists to grapple with -- and those doubts increasingly undermine projections for what’s known as a “V-shaped recovery,” in which lost output is quickly restored.

Rather than sounding a decisive “all clear,” health authorities seem likely to advocate a gradual return to normal working life, so the behavior known as “social distancing” may stick around.

Along with financial blows sustained during the downturn, that is likely to damp spending on travel or spending at shops or restaurants -- assuming those businesses can stay afloat in the first place.

“It takes more time to get ‘back to play’ than to ‘get back to work’,” said Catherine Mann, chief economist at Citigroup Inc. This “underpins concerns for the trajectory for services-dependent advanced economies in the second half of 2020,” she said.

Note: Map shows rate decisions since the start of the year

Consumer caution is already evident in China, even though authorities say it’s safe to go back into the marketplace, and it could happen elsewhere.

That’s why Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, likens his forecast to a “Nike swoosh” rather than a V- or U-shaped rebound. He says U.S. output alone could plunge at an annualized pace of as much as 25% in the second quarter, bounce back by up to 15% in the third, then stall in the fourth with the economy “basically limping along.”

Much will depend on how fast businesses bring back jobs. The International Labor Organization warns 25 million positions may be shed, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said on Tuesday it expected U.S. unemployment to soar to 15%.

Mckinsey & Co. notes one quarter of U.S. households already live from paycheck to paycheck, and that 40% of Americans are unable to cover an unexpected expense of $400 without borrowing.

Stiglitz worries about what he calls “financial gridlock” in which households and companies can’t pay bills, forcing those they owe to into bankruptcy and default as well and so on.

That threat could be heightened by the scale of borrowing in recent years. The Institute of International Finance estimates household debt -- as a share of output -- is at record levels in several economies.

Who’s Borrowing? In many countries, households didn’t delever after the financial crisis

Source: Bank for International Settlements

Corporate borrowing has also hit a high in countries including France and the U.S. Those debts along with the collapse in earnings and slide in equities may limit the ability of companies to reboot after the crisis, with some also likely to be hurt by the collapse in oil prices.

“In any recovery, firms may need to sell shares or slash capex to reduce debt or repay government assistance,” said Charles Dumas of TS Lombard.

Keen to avoid an extended recession, policy makers have been taking emergency measures on a scale that likely exceeds even the response to the 2008 financial crisis. They’re extending credit lifelines to business, paying cash to households, and helping companies cover their wage bills so they don’t have to fire workers. Central banks have slashed interest rates and started new asset-purchase programs.

The strongest argument for a rapid recovery is what economists call “pent-up demand” -- a label that applies quite literally in the current crisis.

Economies shuddered to a halt when people were forced to hunker down at home, so there should be a corresponding upswing when they’re allowed out again -- especially with governments everywhere injecting cash to speed the process.

“Assuming the outbreak peaks by April/May, this will likely set the stage for a recovery in the second half of 2020,” said Chetan Ahya, chief economist at Morgan Stanley.

He predicts the global economy will contract 2.3% on an annualized basis in the first half of the year before growing 1.5% in the second half. Even that scenario means the U.S. and euro area won’t regain their pre-crisis levels of output until the third quarter of 2021.

Bond-Purchasing Programs The coronavirus pandemic has driven more central banks to buy bonds

Source: Bloomberg

At JPMorgan Chase & Co., economists led by Bruce Kasman are citing emerging markets as another source of concern. They’re being pinched by gains in the dollar and the outflow of foreign-held capital, pushing up local borrowing costs.

The most encouraging virus news for economists at the moment comes from Asia, which suffered the first outbreaks but appears to have gotten them under a degree of control.

China is cranking back into action, with numbers released on Tuesday showing manufacturing activity rebounded strongly in March.

Demand in the domestic market is reviving, as lockdowns ease and consumers return to the shops or showrooms. Auto sales, for example, have been ticking higher for weeks, though they’re still down some 40% from last year’s level.

What Bloomberg’s Economists Say... “If outbreaks in other countries follow the same trajectory, the world economy could be up and running again by the start of the second half. But that’s far from guaranteed. Past pandemics lasted years, not months. Scientists at Imperial College London are warning containment measures may have to stay in place for 18 months.”

-- Tom Orlik, chief economist. See {BECO <GO>}

International orders, though, may take longer to recover. Because other economies got hit later by the virus, they’re seeing a slump in demand for imports just as China’s export engine is revving up again. That feedback loop may undermine other recoveries too.

And in China, as in other countries, economics will continue to depend on epidemiology for some time to come. Even as overall progress is made toward containing the coronavirus and developing a vaccine, there’s no guarantee that the movement will be in one direction.

Instead there could be “aftershocks following the initial outbreak, with restrictions being re-imposed and lifted so as to manage the capacity of the healthcare system to cope,” said Keith Wade, chief economist at Schroder Investment Management. “In economic terms, this would lead to a double-dip recession.”

History also suggests reason to worry. A just-published study of pandemics and armed conflicts found such shocks typically weigh on wages and investment for years to come.

Occasionally I'll order from an online retailer. My decision to go to Amazon or Target depends on the nature of the item and how immediately I need it.

I'm just not sure how these guys can survive. I can only think of a few reasons why you'd go to one of these stores ever. My theory is that the older generations are comfortable going to a specialty retailer where they know they can get what they need.

Yeah, basically I think that Amazon, Target, and Wal-Mart actually still have a lot of room to grow as they continue to eat up these specialty retailers. Some will survive, maybe jewelry stores or some very specialized retailers like that. But most of these will be gone in 10 years."

# Oil selling below $10/bbl at key American hubs

By **SHEELA TOBBEN** on **3/31/2020**

NEW YORK (Bloomberg) --Oil is selling for less than $10 across key North American hubs as the global demand shock from coronavirus leaves crude with nowhere to go.

The coronavirus pandemic has hit demand so hard that as benchmark futures plunge to lowest in 18 years, oil is backing up throughout the distribution system, raising the prospect that producers will need to shut in wells. Some of the hardest-hit areas have been those thousands of miles from export terminals, which would provide the possibility of escape, either to foreign markets or onto tankers as floating storage.

Refiners across the U.S., including PBF Energy Inc., Valero Energy Corp. and Phillips 66, are slowing fuel production as restrictions on travel and work has reduced gasoline and jet fuel demand to a trickle. North Atlantic Refining Ltd will be idling its 130,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Newfoundland, Canada, for two to five months due to the outbreak.

The market is groaning under the weight of this oversupply so much so that U.S. midstream operators such as Plains All American Pipelines have asked their suppliers to reduce oil production because storage capacity is reaching its limits.

Bakken crude in Guernsey, Wyoming, sank to a record-low $3.18 a barrel Monday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while Western Canadian Select in Hardisty, Alberta, was worth just $4.18. Even oil in West Texas is as cheap as it’s ever been. West Texas Intermediate in Midland was $10.68, just above its all-time low from 1998. And it’s lower-quality counterpart, West Texas Sour, slid to a record $7.18, the lowest in data going back to 1988.

West Texas Intermediate Light, also known as WTL, traded at around $7.50 a barrel below the WTI Midland benchmark on Monday, traders said, the equivalent of about $3 a barrel outright. Including transportation costs from the wellhead, that would mean the very light crude is worth near-zero, if not negative, when it comes out of the ground.

Even oil that makes it to a dock isn’t immune from the price plunge, as refineries around the world slow down. U.S. oil for export from Corpus Christi -- the end point of several new Permian pipelines and a major exporting hub -- traded at $15 a barrel below July Brent, according to traders."
2020-04-02,Is_this_a_con,1,Cryptos - is there a compelling argument?,"I’ve had 2 “eureka” moments about cryptos recently.  I sent $100 from one bank to another one overseas – and almost all of it was swallowed up in fees. Then I tried to send $10 to a guy for his IPTV service – and it turned into $16 after Paypal had taken their $6 fees. That’s 60%, geez! I thought I’d seen the light, so I bought my first batch of BTC. But I’m still confused. Its evangelists say it’s “digital gold”, a store of value due to its limited supply, and it will take over the world. But what’s to stop others coming in and creating more, blending all the best bits of those currently on offer? You can’t call it a store of value cos it’s limited and If anyone thinks govts and banks are gonna roll over and die they must be crazy. Not gonna happen! I think cryptos will have to abandon their anti-establishment mindsets and work with them. What’s more the US Fed Reserve is talking about creating its own crypto. So is Facebook. More will follow. If they create open-source cryptos, perhaps also with a maximum supply, they will not only have the establishment on their side but most of the mainstream public too. Can someone explain why BTC has a guaranteed future? I'll be eternally grateful. Thanks!"

2020-04-01,spacecadet1984,13,Can the Fed really buy commercial and government issued paper to infinity??,"Ive been think about this a lot lately. Of course they would say they will purchase until the cows come home, but can they really? 

I think they are constrained by 1 of their dual mandates, inflation.  I believe this won't be changed because the powers that be, the elite Americans who hold the keys, would have their fortunes eroded should high inflation kick in.  At this point, the Fed would limit its buying paper bonds and limit funding.

1) since the deflationary pressures are currently very strong, this risk is low at the moment.

2) the Fed is heavily distorting the price of bonds. Especially private sector bonds.  Risk of default has increased dramatically, so naturally any lender would need a higher return to offset this risk....but instead, rates are dropping un naturally due to the FED intervention. As the spread of real versus artificial cost of this paper widens, many many companies will not be selling to any rational private person, so the FED will need to buy, rocketing up their balance sheet.

What happens when a lot of these companies go bankrupt? If it is real estate backed then over time this land can be auctioned back off to the public.

But what about companies whose equipment rusts and deteriorates, companies whose vaule is more intrinsic, etc....when companies whose value is not in land or gold, something that can't last 50 years....what then? 

Does the dollar get destroyed? How? Interest rates skyrocket?

Answer:  i think interest rates will skyrocket after inflation picks up and the Fed stops buying commercial paper and as much government bonds.  I think what will happen is the Fed will continue this program, but unlike 2008-09, as real demand has crumbled from underneath the feet, the cash injected will start to bid up the shrinking circle of areas that cash can be used to buy for investment. 

 Inflation begins.  If this happens the Fed has to cut back their purchasing and interest rates will sling shot up to the real world.  



So how long can this go on for? And what is the long term (maybe short) cost of what the Fed is doing going to be?"

2020-04-02,ardent_maurader,0,Here's why the market went up for a couple of days at the end of March,"The only reason the market had a few 'up days' is because we were coming to the end of the quarter.  During that time many of the mutual funds had to re-balance their portfolios in order to make sure that they were in compliance with their portfolio mix.  

i.e. A Fund built on a 40% equities (shares) 60% securities (bonds) structure would have lost a lot of value in their equities side in the past month, and so they would be forced to sell off some bonds and buy additional shares in order to get back into their 40%/60% split before the end of the quarter.

So about 800 billion of the activity that happened at the end of march was due to funds re-balancing.  As soon as April 1st hit we were back to the 'normal' market factors and things started to fall again.

2020-04-01,TikiB,6,April 1st Analysis - Canadian Edition,"Here is my post from [yesterday](https://old.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fsk673/march_31st_analyst_canadian_names_edition/).  I am going to start explaining what plays I see coming using technical analysis.

**Gold Miners win the day -**I mentioned last few days that gold was due to bounce.  Today was the day.  When SPY is weak people tend to flock to gold.  I should have played this differently and here is why.  Gold names like Kinross Gold, B2gold Corp, Yamana gold all bounced 50% in a few days.  Using FIB retracement, all dropped back between 50-75% of the gains.  This should have been a signal to scale in.  It is very unlikely that after such a huge bounce that you would straight flush those gains away.  Once you hit 50% retracement, scaling in would have been a smart play.   Given how much it did fall, I expect equilibrium for a few days.

**Energy Names fall hard but rebound -**I noted energy names like Suncor, CDN Resources and Crescent Point all bounced hard last couple days.  Given SPY weakness they dropped double digit percentage.  They all to a certain extent bounced back ending up down between 1-4%.  Suncor and CDN look like potential bull flags and could break through to continue the daily uptrend.  Crescent point and Cenovus (which i will start covering) have dropped too much and equilibrium is more likely.

**Canopy Growth -** you see -5% and think that is a decent pullback until you go out to daily and see that it held support from March 30th and remains in an uptrend.  If SPY is weak tomorrow it could break this support and begin its much needed consolidation.

**Air Canada -** down 8% today,  I'll start looking when it hits around $10 CDN

**Bombardier -** still remains in equilibrium.  You can bottom fish around $0.41/$0.42

**Blackberry -** popped up on my screen down 17%.  This was due to analyst reducing forecasts.  From a technical analysis you don't play charts based on news.  I will continue to watch but from chart perspective nothing to do."
2020-04-01,mightyduck19,4,WFC vs FNCL,"Heyo, just hoping for some general thoughts/perspective (not necessarily direct advice)  -- TIA!

&#x200B;

I'm currently sitting at -42% on Wells Fargo (WFC). I don't feel too terrible about the position but I have been considering selling it and immediately buying back into FNCL instead. FNCL is just a broad base finance ETF if you're not familiar (top 5 holdings: JPM, BRKB, BAC, WFC, C).

As I see it, owning anything in the finance sector at this point in time is basically a long term bet in high level gov/fed policy migrating back to a more ""normal"" realm within the next 3-5 years. Switching this position from WFC to FNCL seems like it would help emphasize that aspect of the thesis and reduce risk associated with any WFC specific issues that may or may not arise in the future.  

I definitely wouldn't expect either position to see great growth over the next 3-5 years but I do want some exposure to the space for diversification purposes if nothing else.

2020-04-02,whossayn,2,Cardlytics (check my thinking?),"Cardlytics is an advertising company of sorts. They essentially partner up with financial services companies and get access to transaction information, which they turn into valuable information that can be used for high return on spend advertising. If you’ve gotten bank of america promotions, or chase bank promotions for certain discounted products- that’s been cardlytics. 

Now to my main theses about why i think they’re a great company.

1. Network effects. 

Needless to say, their business model suggests that the more (and larger) FI’s they partner up with, the more valuable they become to advertising customers, and the more advertising customers they attract the more attractive they become to FIs.

2. Switching costs

The company has disclosed that it can take up to *years* to integrate into an FI partner, this makes sense seeing that their software is embedded deeply within FI’s. Given how lengthy the integration process is, would an FI really switch to a competitor just to get a similar result? (Also remember, network effects help suggest why FIs wouldn’t want to move)

3. Exclusivity 

Cardlytics has disclosed that FIs typically do not have the capability to integrate more than one advertiser into their business (only one business can be integrated to have access to the transactions). This point speaks for itself.

These three structural competitive advantages work together very nicely in my opinion to suggest favourable future prospects for this company.

4. Debt Position

In our current environment it is safe to say lots of debt (obviously considering if lots of earnings can cover it) is not ideal. Cardlytics has almost no debt on its balance sheet. 

5. Potential disruptor?

Cardlytics is a very unique company and one of the first to engage in this sort of business. The company boasts returns as high at 30:1 for advertising spend. I can easily see this growing in popularity amongst advertisers who *especially coming out of this environment* want the most bang for their buck.

Let me know what you think, this isn’t a “will it go up?” post, i just want to know if people agree with me on the quality of the business, or if there are concerns/ red flags i’ve overlooked."

2020-04-01,street-guru,4,$HD and $LOW worth holding on to:,"Street estimates for the Home Improvement space are coming down to reflect the COVID-19 impact, but sales have held up relatively well so far. Analyst checks indicate solid demand just before the pandemic, including big ticket categories like flooring. Home improvement trends even accelerated into March, with particular strength in lawn/garden, and other at-home activities like paint and outdoor projects.

Q1 appears set up for a beat for both HD and LOW, but of course the focus will be on the inevitable slowdown in Q2. With social distancing and greater hurdles to obtaining permits and inspections etc, existing home sales dropped off into March and weakened through the month. More importantly, employment must stabilize for things to recover.

Nonetheless, HD and LOW should be in a better spot that the last downturn. For one, this recession is not housing-driven. Home prices (correlated with improvement spending) should hold up better than the last downturn given the tighter supply. Median home age has increased 25% since 2006 and size increased 11%. With repairs and maintenance making up 2/3 of the sector's business, this chunk of revenue should be relatively stable."

2020-03-31,Rmogo21,75,Long Term Leveraged ETF Strategy | TQQQ,"The swing trading strategy I am going to share with you has produced a 815% return on 48 trades since 2-10-2010. It makes 22.31% on average when it is correct, -3.93% when it is wrong and works 37.5% of the time. I encourage discussion but please read my explanation +before jumping to conclusions. This is a back-tested strategy as you will see. The SPY during this same period returned 140%.

This method is a modified version of what Dr. Eric Wish of UMD developed : [https://wishingwealthblog.com/2017/01/tqqq-again-beats-almost-all-individual-stocks-etf-performance-since-gmi-turned-green-on-111016/](https://wishingwealthblog.com/2017/01/tqqq-again-beats-almost-all-individual-stocks-etf-performance-since-gmi-turned-green-on-111016/)

Leveraged ETFs are very useful for day/short term traders as they increase the volatility of the underlying equity.

Most people agree however that they are not suitable for long term investors due to high fees and volatility drag (decay). These are certainly things to think about if you decided to use these instruments.

Volatility drag is the biggest issue as many people point out. For instance if you had 50 days straight of alternating +5% and -5% moves in the etf, at the end of the streak you would be left with 93.9% of your initial money, and a 6% loss is quit manageable. However if during the same streak you had your money in a 3x leveraged etf with +15% and -15% moves, you would be left with only an abysmal 56.6% of your initial cash.

This is because losses work geometrically against you, consider the following

3% loss needs a 3.09% gain to reach breakeven

5% loss needs a 5.26% gain to reach breakeven

10% loss needs a 11.11% gain to reach breakeven

20% loss needs a 25% gain to reach breakeven

25% loss needs a 33.33% gain to reach breakeven

30% loss needs a **42.85%** gain to reach breakeven

40% loss needs a **66.66% gain** to reach breakeven

50% loss needs a **100% gain** to reach breakeven

This is why it is so important to not fall in love with a stock. Even if you are a long term investor have a line in the sand where you will sell. Otherwise you are not compounding your money, you are compounding your losses.

I bring this up to say that a successful leveraged ETF strategy needs to take advantage of the upside possibilities while ruthlessly cutting losses if the trend breaks. The goal is to have an excellent gain to loss ratio of over 3:1. With this a strategy’s break even point is a 25% success rate meaning you can be right only a quarter of the time. The actual strategy has a p/l ratio of 5.67 and a success rate of 37.5% meaning it works extremely well.

The strategy is this:

Create 6 short term daily EMAs, color them red, find the minimum of them

Create 6 longer term daily EMAs color them blue, find their maximum

Enter when the all the reds are first over the blues with a 3% stop loss. Sell when the stop loss is hit or any red EMA crosses below a blue.

That’s it, and you will find this is an excellent way of timing the market and visualizing its trend.

I have created a python back testing program to test different length EMAs, different stop losses, adding a SMA restriction…

You can try it for yourself here: [https://repl.it/@RichardMoglenMo/RWB-with-Stop-loss](https://repl.it/@RichardMoglenMo/RWB-with-Stop-loss)

1. Run the program by hitting the green arrow, it will have to download some libraries
2. Enter the Ticket Symbol you want to test- I use TQQQ
3. Enter the Start date of the test- I use 1/1/2010
4. Enter Six Short term red emas- I use 5,6,8,10,12,15
5. Enter Six longer term blue emas- I use 30,35,40,45,50,60
6. If you want a simple moving average restriction enter a period (So it will only enter if the current price is over that moving average) Otherwise enter 0-I use 0
7. Enter a stop loss % I use 3%
8. Press enter

My suggestions yield a return of 815% in about 10 years which would turn a 10k initial investment into 91.5k. It also outputs some key statistics such as max gain, max loss and holding periods.

I use this strategy with a portion of my portfolio as it outperforms almost every individual stock pick during uptrends (defined as when the red emas are above blue emas in the index etfs QQQ, SPY)"

Is this correct?

My understanding is that stocks went up simply because the market was inflated in this process. Basically the same amount that something like milk would go up in price at the market if fed just printed and sent all that money to Americans. 

Assuming all of those loans get paid back, does this create a temporary inflation?

Here are my top reasons why CSX is a long-term hold for me:  


* The railroad is an essential part of the supply-chain, and despite the outbreak of  COVID19, they remain open for business. In terms of volumes, carloads are down only 1.4% QTD. Core economy continues to move though, inventories have been depleted, given slow-downs in production in Asia, as well as increased demand for consumer good carloads.
* Impressive contingency plans to avoid a network shutdown. That includes four sites which can be turned if its primary location is impacted.
* They ended FY 2019 with 2bn in cash and 2.7x debt/EBITDA.
* Low cost structure among its peers (operating ratio is sub 60%) as they have executed a Precision Scheduled Railroad (PSR) model for a few years now."

2020-04-01,Reptar4President,17,Some Potentially Undervalued Stocks,"Hi, I’m looking at putting some money into a few different small and micro-caps, and one big boy. Thought I'd put them out there and see if anyone has any thoughts on them.

Some background: I used to trade individual stocks (we're not talking much, I had maybe $20k in a fund) but stopped about 6 years ago, as I just didn’t have time to keep up with the market anymore. I moved everything into Vanguard ETFs and all that is fine and still sitting there. I have more time available now, as well as more money, and it seems like as good a time as any to get back into the market with some money I can afford to play around with (and lose without it ruining me).

I try to stay away from industries I can’t understand. Biotech, for example. I just trade long, nothing short. I’ll never beat the pros and the fees would kill me anyway. With one real exception, GM, I'm just looking for undervalued small or micro-caps with solid fundamentals under the hood and room for growth. Ideally with a dividend but not required. Should be earning solid cash flow and limited, if any, long-term debt. Right now, I’m mostly looking at stocks trading under $50/share. Here's what I'm looking at:

They all appear to me to have good fundamentals. Low LT D/E, good cash flow. Reasonable P/Es, not overvalued, and room for growth. I’ve been digging into the 10-Ks and I don’t see anything glaring. Foot Locker feels like one of Buffett’s cigarette butts. Maybe it’s in a dying retail business but, based on their fundamentals, I think they have a few good puffs left.

NVFY is really interesting to me. I can't decide if I want to put money into them or not. They've got a really good business selling furniture, mostly in LA, Hong Kong, and Macau. They're sitting on a ton of assets, worth more than their price. No debt, great cash flow. Seem to be making money hand-over-fist. But they just got hit with a series of related class action lawsuits and coronavirus has basically stopped their business in its tracks. So the fundamentals are really good but they have these pretty big obstacles right now that could kill them. It's an interesting situation.

I don’t think I need to write out a treatise for each unless someone wants to know my thinking, but they all look good to me with the possible exception of NVFY. Curious if anyone has any thoughts about them. Feel free to mock me if these are stupid thoughts."

Checking the actual Form 4 forms, we verify that there is no explanation or pre-arranged plan for these purchases.

Dynex does have ownership requirements that require directors to hold 3x their retainer fee in stock, the CEO to hold 5x their salary in stock, and the other specified executives to hold 3x their salary in stock.

Before the market crashed, all of the directors and executives were well above their ownership guidelines. The market crash pushed the CEO and EVP below their threshold, but their purchases did not put them back over the threshold (they have until December 31, 2020, to reach the threshold).

# 2) SITE Centers Corp ($SITC) - Insider Purchases

SITE Form 4 Activity -> [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&CIK=894315&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&CIK=894315&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0)

From Yahoo Finance:

>SITE Centers is an owner and manager of open-air shopping centers that provide a highly-compelling shopping experience and merchandise mix for retail partners and consumers

The start of 2020 has been rough for SITE. They entered 2020 with a stock price near $12.75 and then saw it fall 55% to its closing price of $5.67 on March 20th.

The recent Form 4 activity shows their CEO, CFO, and a Director making purchases on the open market. The CEO made a sizable $568,000 worth of purchases while the Director and CFO increased their positions by 11% and 23% respectively.

The individual Form 4 forms show that there was no explanation given for the purchases, so we can assume these were not part of some pre-arranged plan.

SITE has ownership requirements requiring the CEO to own 5x their salary in stocks, the COO and CFO to hold 3x their salaries, and the Directors to own 5x their cash retainers.

Before the market crash, all of the executives were above the stock ownership thresholds (except for the CFO who recently became CFO and has until March 31, 2025, to meet the requirement). The market crash put the CEO well below his ownership requirement and his purchases did not put him back over the requirement.

*\* Mr. Fennerty’s salary was not present in the most recent Proxy Statement because he just recently became CFO, so we just used the old CFO’s salary for this table\**

SITE has 4 executives that must file their trades publicly, and we only see the CEO and CFO making open market purchases. This is obviously less compelling than if all 4 executives were to have made purchases, but the CEO paying over $500,000 to increase his holding by over 40% is still noteworthy.

# 3) Chimera Investment Corp ($CIM) - Insider Purchases

CIM Form 4s -> [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&CIK=1409493&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/own-disp?action=getissuer&CIK=1409493&type=&dateb=&owner=include&start=0)

We wrote about Chimera last week, but they recently amended their Form 4s to clarify that what they previously said were stock grants were actually purchases by the executives and directors.

From Yahoo Finance:

>Chimera Investment Corporation operates as a real estate investment trust in the United States. The company, through its subsidiaries, invests in a portfolio of mortgage assets, including residential mortgage loans, agency and non-agency residential mortgage-backed securities, agency mortgage-backed securities secured by pools of commercial mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans, and other real estate related securities

Chimera was on a slight upward trajectory during the beginning of the year before falling 58% from their high of $22.98 to their closing price on March 20th of $9.55.

Their Form 4 activity shows that all of their executives (and one director) made purchases (with 4 of the 5 executives making sizable six-figure purchases) on March 18th.

Looking at the CEO’s individual Form 4, we see that these were in fact open market purchases and not stock grants as was originally reported. The Form 4 also does not mention that these purchases are part of any pre-arranged plans.

The Proxy Statement verifies that Chimera does have ownership guidelines for the executives and directors that require the CEO to own 5x their annual salary in stock, the other named executives to own 3x their salary, and the directors to own 5x their annual cash retainer.

Even with the almost 60% stock decline, all of the executives and the director that purchased stock are well above their required holding threshold (except the Chief Legal Officer).

Any time you have all of the executives making purchases in the open market when the stock price is at its low point, it is worth paying attention to.

# 4) Carpenter Technology Corporation ($CRS) - Insider Purchasing

CRS Form 4s -> [https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=17843&owner=exclude&action=getcompany&Find=Search](https://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/browse-edgar?CIK=17843&owner=exclude&action=getcompany&Find=Search)

From Yahoo Finance:

>Carpenter Technology Corporation manufactures, fabricates, and distributes specialty metals worldwide. It operates through two segments, Specialty Alloys Operations and Performance Engineered Products. The company offers specialty alloys, including titanium alloys, powder metals, stainless steels, alloy steels, and tool steels, as well as drilling tools, and metal powders and parts.

Carpenter Tech has been having a rough start to the year before ultimately crashing a whopping 70% to their low of $14.87 at close on March 20th.

The Form 4 activity shows some purchasing activity by 3 of their executives and 1 of their Directors. Not the most compelling purchasing activity as only 3 of the 5 executives made purchases and most of the purchases weren’t huge, but the General Counsel did purchase $220,000 worth of stock increasing his shares by 49%.

The individual Form 4 forms do not give any explanation for these purchases, so it is safe to assume these purchases are not for any pre-arranged plans.

The Proxy Statement tells us that Carpenter Tech has stock ownership guidelines that require the CEO to own 5x their base salary in stock, the SVPs to own 3x their base salaries, and the VPs to own 2x their base salaries.

Before the market crash, all of the executives were well above their required ownership amount, but the crash put everyone well below their requirements and none of their purchasing activity has pushed them over the requirement.

2020-04-01,ashishkaulo,5,We are heading for a big inflation of prices (pls prove me wrong),"So i have been thinking about the impact of the FED printing so much money. When i look at the basic fundamentals of inflation the following formula applies:

M x V = P x Y = GDP

In the current situation not much is happening to inflation because we have the following conditions:

Monetary supply is increasing, M goes up

Velocity of spending is decreasing since we have a corona crisis, V goes down

So now what if the GDP drops this year because the corona crisis bankrupts a lot of small businesses. As soon as the crisis ends we have a lower Y but a higher Velocity (people can spend again).

There are less Goods and services created, Y goes down

M is still up 

V goes up, (especially when interest rates remain near 0%, saving makes no sense)

P has to go up, wich means inflation. 

So are we getting an abnormal amount of inflation?"

**GOLD - Trading environment:**

&#x200B;

* Gold prices dipped back below $1600 per ounce in London trade Tuesday, retreating $100 per ounce from early March’s new 7-year highs, as world stock markets struggled to extend their week-long rally in the face of awful economic data and forecasts as the spread of coronavirus accelerated.
* Shanghai gold prices today fell nearly $18 per ounce below comparable London quotes, showing a discount to the world’s central trading and storage hub for all but 3 days this March.

**OIL - Trading environment:**

* The contango for Brent between May and November has widened to a record $13.45 per barrel, a reflection of the massive short-term glut.
* The oil market supply chains are broken due to the unbelievably large losses in oil demand, forcing all available alternatives of supply chain adjustments to take place during April and May.

**ECONOMICS - Where we are heading at:**

* US GDP contracting by 9% in Q1 and 34% in Q2 in annualized terms.
* Jobless rate reaching 15% by July - the highest level of unemployment of the Great Depression in 1939.
* US unemployment could reach over 32% by mid-year according to back-of-an-envelope estimates in a new blog post from the St.Louis Federal Reserve, with more than 47 million lay-offs between April and June.

2020-03-31,hasbs,46,Here's a guide on how to formally submit a complaint to Questrade and how to potentially get an offer.,"So as I am sure many people are aware Questrade has been an absolute disaster the past 2 weeks and many of you have lost money due to their outages or charts and orders being down. Simply contacting customer service is not enough to get any kind of compensation for this. 

Many people have linked the OBSI website or other PDFs

https://www.iiroc.ca/investors/makingacomplaint/Pages/default.aspx

https://www.iiroc.ca/industry/member-resources/Documents/IIROC_Complaints_Brochure_en.pdf

https://www.iiroc.ca/industry/member-resources/Documents/IIROC_How_Do_I_Get_Money_Back_Brochure_en.pdf


But I understand that most people don't have the time or energy to go through this. So I'll give you the relevant information you need including email addresses. 

The first thing you have to do is email the Questrade compliance department. If you ask Questrade support for this they will not give you the correct email. They will likely give you something like ""support.questrade.com"".

**The correct person to write a formal complaint to is Mary Joyce Empansando.** You can find her email here under ""Principal Contacts"".

https://pmac.org/firm/questrade-wealth-management-inc/



As you can see [here](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/mary-joyce-empensando-548aab7) she is the chief compliance officer at Questrade. 

To confirm this is the correct email you can call OBSI at 416 287-2877 (or toll free at 1 855 889-6274) and explain your situation and they will give you the same information. 

Once you have written to Mary Joyce the compliance department has 90 days to give you an offer. 

If you are not satisfied with their offer you have 180 days from the date of receiving an offer to reach out to OBSI. OR if they do not reply in 90 days you can also reach out to OBSI. 

OBSI will ask you for a copy of your written complaint. A copy of their response. As well as a reason for why you are not satisfied with their offer. I am not including OBSI's email for you to forward this to because until you get a response from Questrade you will not need this. When that happens you can call the number I provided and ask them for the email and they will provide you with it. 

From that point on you will coordinate with OBSI. 



________________________________________

What can you expect for an offer from Questrade? Honestly? Not much. They'll likely just offer you back your commissions from the days you were affected. Maybe a bit more. 


This is pretty much the first step for dealing with the OBSI. 


Your other two options are going to court or arbitration which both have costs associated with them. Arbitration is generally going to be the cheaper option but I think for most people these two options will not be worth it. 

The guide I outlined above is free. OBSI doesn't charge you anything. 


Well... best of of luck to anyone who chooses to pursue this option."

2020-04-01,green9206,2,Identifying base and bottom formation(Theory),"I watched a show in my country about how to identify whether a base or bottom formation is taking place. I am writing a summary of it here so maybe it might be a little helpful to you. If not you can just ignore this. 

Ok First we need to take into account the lowest closing of the index, in this case am taking S&P 500. The lowest closing was 2237.40 on Mar 23. And to identify whether a base formation is happening or not, the first condition is that the index must close atleast 5% above the lowest closing level for the next 9 trading sessions. So 5% above in this case would be 2349.27 and the index has continued to close above 2349.27 everyday since so base formation is happening for sure. This is for Base Formation. Even if the conditions here are not met, for example if index closes below 5% above the lowest closing, the cycle begins again once it again closes minimum 5% above and continues to do so for 9 consecutive sessions after that. Now we move to Bottom Formation. 

Now we have to try to understand whether the low of 2237.40 was the bottom . Now nobody can predict the bottom and we're not trying to do that, we are trying to understand the probability that 2237.40 was the bottom or not and to do that, the condition here is that out of the 9 trading sessions following the lowest closing, one of the closing needs to be atleast 10% above the lowest closing, so 10% above 2237.40 so that would be 2461.14. So the first time we got a closing above that level was on March 25 of 2475.56. But the important thing is every consecutive closing after that should be above 2461.14 and so far S&P 500 has given a closing above it. Another condition is out of the total 9 trading sessions following March 23, atleast 6 of the sessions must close in the positive. So far in the 6 trading sessions that have happened since, 4 has been a positive close and 2 have been negative so its quite important that in the next 3 trading sessions, atleast 2 are positive(this indicates market sentiment). And not only that but the next 3 trading sessions also must have a closing above 2461.14. If either of these conditions are not met then the probability that 2237.40 was THE low diminishes and the index would once again need to close minimum 10% above the lowest level for the next 9 trading sessions but if the conditions are met the PROBABILITY that 2237.40 was the low increases considerably. That's for Bottom Formation . So next 3 trading sessions are very important. If S&P 500 closes below 2461.14 this week then the probability that March 23 was the bottom goes down so some of you who have FOMO will have another chance to get in at better valuations but if all conditions are met i.e. 2 positive closing and all closings above 2461.14 then 2237.40 was probably the bottom and some of you missed out on it and thats ok because future will always give you more opportunities so don't feel too bad.

And finally this is something i watched on tv by a ""market expert"" who said he did a lot of research on 2001 and 2008 pattern before coming up with this theory so obviously please take with a handful of salt."

2020-04-01,maid113,7,X-post with r/stocks because this will also be useful for you guys: here is what I have done in portfolios with various risk levels,"Last week I posted my predictions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/fpcf7r/this_is_the_blip_in_the_market_before_the_next/flmeqv9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x). However, predictions are one thing and the overall market is another. I am going to try posting daily here to try and help everyone out. I am mostly a futures trader, but I handle a lot of client money and have been asked recently to manage portfolios and 401k's as well as I have a pretty good insight into the market movement. So this will be the start of my daily market movement journal for reddit. Let's start with aggressive portfolios.

Aggressive

Although this is aggressive it is not quite r/wsb level aggressive as this is where I keep my personal money and some friends who like me can weather the storm with anything. In my comment last week I mentioned that I took an initial short of 5% of my portfolio at the es\_f 2630 level simply due to the 9 day moving average. Well, this level has now been holding in the market and we have been unable to break above. This morning after we again couldn't break above I added to my short position and now am overall 20% short at an average price of 2624.25. At the same time I have been adding to my long cl\_f position and am now long 50% of my portfolio at an average price of 20.13. I am keeping the other 30% cash and not moving anything around at this time. I have moved money into this account in order to buy more just because of how sure I am with everything. I am very comfortable at these levels so am not worried at all. If the market closes above the 9 day moving average I plan on increasing my risk and overall es position size to 5%, and if cl continues lower I plan on buying more, I plan on buying more cl no matter what as the current price is unprecedented and I have basically 0 risk since I can fund any decline at this point.


Moderate

For moderate portfolios which is what I have been doing with my client portfolios I am now mostly in oil and cash. The past few weeks I was short the market 30% of account value while holding 20% in bonds and 50% in cash. two weeks ago I began exiting the short positions and holding cash. On Monday I began going long in my client portfolios first with 15% long, 20% bonds, and 65% cash. Then increased on wednesday to 30% long 60% cash. Friday as I saw the market crashing before the close I moved the moderate portfolio to 50% long, 20% oil and 30% cash betting that we would have a bounce back up towards 2600 on Monday which did happen. On Monday I then rebalanced everything once more and moved to a 10% long 20% bond, 40% and 30% cash once more just because I would rather keep the profits than risk anything else happening. Today was my final rebalance for the week unless if I see something happening. we are at a point where I don't know where the market will move in the short term so I have now gone 20% bonds, 50% oil and 30% cash. As you can see I am pretty sure with oil. Although with a moderate strategy I am not doing oil futures I am instead in $UCO as the risk is less with it but the amount to be made is still substantial.


Conservative

Ok, here is where I will talk about what I have done mostly in 401k's where I can only be in either funds or bonds. I manage 401k's currently for 5 clients and my wife, my main priority of course is skewed towards her so I will to you what I do with her 401k. Today I moved her to 100% US bonds, and will keep it that way until I see a possible bottom. This is again due to me not knowing where the overall market will be moving the next few days. I was 100% large cap value funds on Friday and Monday at close rebalanced to 15% stock and 85% bonds. Today with the market drop I moved everything to bonds and plan on keeping it that way. Last week I moved everything from 100% bonds on to 50% stock/50% bonds on Monday and increased it on Friday to 100% stock because of what I mentioned above.


Like I said I plan to be posting here more frequently but this is a good start. Today was a little rough because I am just starting off and wanted to give details on what I have been doing the past few weeks and how I got to where it is today. If you have any questions don't hesitate to ask. I will talk about some market analysis but my main goal is to help everyone make money throughout this.

Edit: Looks like I’m in pretty good profit on my short es position. I will be holding now and my exit plan will be a close above the 9 SMA on the 4 hour chart."

I mean, nobody really knows when the corona virus will peak, global unemployment is at its highest point since 2008, the IMF predicted that we are going to face a severe recession and the economy is not functioning efficient because so many businesses are closed. Moreover, the GDP of the EU and US has been going down steadily lately. It doesn't stop here, the national debt of the US is reaching a massive amount. Statistics show us that its debt increases by 55.000$ each second. Graphs show us that the national debt of the US will be hitting 10 billion dollars in a couple of months, which is incomprehensible. I honestly expected one month ago that the Dow would bottom under 10k.

2020-04-01,WhichEdge,2,WCS - The Reality?,"So I spent time in my life living in Western Canada and still have friends back in Canada and in the oil provinces.

I noticed in the market that WCS went below $4 a barrel for a bit in I think CDN.

WCS can't stand for all oil though in Canada right because I noticed that the market was up a bit for the TSX/TSE and the oil companies with it.

I can't imagine that the oil companies would be up if WCS counted for what they would get for their oil.

So is WCS just a small part of the Canadian and particular Western Canada oil market or what is the reality of this and why is it so damn cheap?

And if it is a big part of the oil companies stock why would the oil companies be up as its went beyond low?"

2020-03-31,LFG530,14,Is this financial crisis more similar to a war than to previous pandemics?,"So far I feel the dynamic and market conditions are very similar to the begining WWII (especially in european markets since the war was actually on their territory) for the following reasons :

- We are at the end of a close to 10 years bull run following a major crash
- A lot of socialistic measures are put in place to support the population in this context
- There is a lot of fear and uncertainty, people won't feel safe to travel for a while
- Governments around the world are playing a major role in the economy and are pushing industry to shift production towards common goals that have no real economic benifit other than fighting a common enemy
- Governments are contracting a lot of debt and people are worried about the long term impact of this ""reckless"" spending 

Obviously the global quarantaine element is unseen,  but mitigated by the existence of e-commerce and the internet. Also, hopefully the timespan of this event is shorter and more predictible. 

Still, I think the markets are following a world war logic and analysis of the european markets from 1939 to 1950 should be the best indicator of what might happen in the US. The US markets are also interesting to look at during that time especially around the USA involvment and Pearl Harbor.

I am aware this is not a ground breaking in depth analysis, I mainly want to know what you people think. Why wouldn't the comparison hold up? Is there any event that would be more closely related in your opinion? Feel free to discuss."

2020-03-31,UofMBasketball,5,What is the Purpose of Hedging if You're Long Term?,"Hi,

So I'm seeing quiet a few posts talking about hedging by buying puts or I guess going into cash in order to hedge against their stocks in this time. I can understand the reasoning because if the market falls, then the puts gain in value, which you can sell to buy stock at a cheaper price.

My question is hedging just seem like a -EV move in order to reduce volatility, but why does volatility matter if you're planning on holding for a long time? I feel like hedging is inherently a way to try to time the market, which is very hard to do because you'd be at a loss with hedging unless stocks go down.  I get why someone near retirement or someone who needs money to pay bills would try to hedge to not get fucked over, but would someone in my situation need to hedge?

I have 25k current in SPY and made another 5k that I was planning on adding soon, but is it worth bothering hedging? I can reasonably expect SPY to be at a higher point in the future, so SPY is a +EV move to me. While options inherently are -EV because of spread and expiring worthless? Am I right about this? Like theoretically if I hedged forever and repeatedly, I would be be at 0 while losing money to spread right? So I would just be better off just putting my money into SPY. 

People are going to say now is different because we are expecting a recession but is it really different. Won't that be factored into put premiums? I feel like it's risky to buy puts right now or ever lmao

I'm not an expert at this. Just read some books and trying to understand."

Needless to say, many small businesses employ them and they are most likely to be let go first.  And even if they didn't, will such businesses get a slice of the stimulus pie, big enough to keep them on the payroll?

Energy/Oil producers power through - CDN Natural Resources and Suncor Energy continued their big follow through finishing up 22% and 18%, both breaking their daily chart bullish.  From 9am yesterday to close today the two have 52% and 39%.  Reasons for this could be confirmation of keystone pipeline construction beginning ASAP, oversold bounces, or some pension plans buying expecting this to recover in the long run.  Crescent Point Energy had gains of 16% earlier today but quadruple topped at $1.19, failing to change their daily trend and pulled back to $1.09, finishing up 7%.  It could be bull flagging on hourly/4 hour timeframe and could test resistance tomorrow.  It may also just be a weaker energy/oil name and could pullback further if Suncor and CDN Resource begins consolidating.

WEED/CGC still holding strong.  SPY dumped at EOD down 1.5%. Canopy basically finished even. Canopy had bounced 80% from the bottom two weeks ago and has only pulled back 14% over past 4 days.  It could be bull flagging on daily or may play equilibrium.  Name to watch.

Gold Miners - GDX down 3.5%.  Most names I am watching down about 1-3%.  Still looking for a higher low on these names as good bounce opportunities.  If some names drop 5% tomorrow I will be entering.  

Other Names:  

Air Canada only down 2%, remains in equilibrium

Bombardier held low of yesterday and bounced big at EOD finishing up 7%.  Looks like an inside candle from yesterday."

Does cash reserves mean they won't dip past a certain stock price percentage down from their ""baseline"" based on their expense rate? Does having assets in real estate/other equities that could be sold if worse comes to worse keep their stock from dropping? Does taking on debt/revolving credit facilities to have cash on hand to deal with upcoming dismal revenues improve their short term prices but eventually come back to bite them?

2020-03-31,ExperimentalDesign,8,Questions about Goodwill,"Hello I have a couple questions about goodwill.

I understand that it is an intangible asset that accounts for the difference between acquisition sale price and Shareholders' Equity (Assets - Liabilities) when one company acquires another. So say if Company A buys Company B at $10, but Company B's Shareholders' Equity is only $7, then Company A will say they paid $7 for tangible S.E. and an extra $3 for intangibles such as brand name, employee relations, etc. 

1) How does this materialize onto a balance sheet? I understand that the acquiring company adds goodwill onto their balance sheet. But do they subtract the cash they paid to buyout the company? Or is it just a redistribution of the cash they paid into assets they gained? If a Company A acquires Company B for $10 will they say they lost $10 cash but gained $10 S.E ($7 being tangible S.E. and $3 being goodwill)?

2) Is it better for a company to have more or less goodwill? More goodwill would indicate they are paying more than they need to when acquiring a company. Or is it not really a good/bad thing but more just a fact of how much of what they paid for in an acquisition is intangible.

3) A high goodwill to asset ratio (>~0.5) indicates that a lot of the assets a company believes it has are not tangible. Isn't this a bad thing? Isn't there an inherent risk of what if the $ a company paid for and estimate they hold in goodwill is a lot larger than the actual goodwill they gained?

4) Why would a company allow itself to be acquired at negative goodwill? Why not just liquidate? Wouldn't they net more money if they liquidate at $7 S.E., rather than taking an acquisition offer of $5? 

Thanks"
2020-04-01,orishasinc2,0,Is the Fed acting foolishly?,"First off, I would like to emphasize that I am supporter and believer in hard money backed and redeemable in gold and silver at 100% as the only sound approach to "" just money"". Therefore, the current Fiat dollar  world reserve currency is in my judgment criminal, unfair, unjust, and more importantly, unsustainable.

However, the recent Fed intervention had been quite shocking to say the least. They have even aroused a great deal of criticism  among keynesians and all sorts of pseudo conservatives.
 The point is, the Fed has proported to engage in an ""unlimited"" QE policy aimed at supporting the US financial markets and economy in times of extreme duress and beyond. Gold and silver coins have been flying off the shelves, and many experts have claimed the beginning of the end to the US dollar hegemony. 

But is it the case? What do you think of it? 

My opinion. 

In the long term, there is no way out for the US dollar. We cannot possibly pay for all our obligations; the future of the US currency is Gold. How the authority will structure that system is another story. While I think we ought to return to a pre WW1 gold standard, the reality is that politicians as always, will try to fool the masses with a pseudo gold standard that still give them the necessary leeway to inflate and make promises for their constituencies. 

However, within the short term, the Fed, unfortunately, has enough room to navigate and increase its balance sheets by trillions increments as the world is, truly, dealing with a Shortage of USD. 

Most countries have been mirroring the Fed policies of low/negative rates while also expending their balance sheets to support their economies. In times of hardship though, investors are fully aware of the fragility of their local currencies, they thus run to the USD for stability at the expense of their own monies. Which logically strengthen the perception of of the USD soundness in relation to all the others currencies. Thus, the dollar shortage is today's Coronavirus hysteria and panic. 

 In an atmosphere of competitive devaluation, the Fed is the one seeing eye in a crowd of blinds. Until things change drastically, which often take a conflict or war, the Fed and the USD will remain the reserve currency and the demand for dollar will remain at worse constant. The Fed is aware of THIS; thus explaining their generous and almost historic expansion of their monetary base to bailout "" everyone"" and Wallstreet in particular.

However, even in a scenario when there's an unprecedented *global* shutdown like this the debt bubble doesn't seem to be in danger of imminently bursting despite many people/institutions making a fraction of revenue that they used to. You'd think that'd mean that with significantly less revenue they can't pay their debts, which would cause what seems to be a bubble to burst and severely hurt the markets. But it's not. How come? And, if it WERE to burst re: GFC, what would the implications of that be to the stock market, society, etc? Thanks!!!

2020-03-31,richards_david,2,"Is gold still a haven asset? Where can investors get ""alpha"" during a market crash?","**Current situation:**

Now that markets are crashing around the world every investor is looking for haven assets, or sources of ""Alpha"". And so did I. I am currently invested into equities, mostly through index tracking ETFs (I find [Robinhood](https://robinhood.com/) very easy to use and also [Vanguard's online trading](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/online-trading/)), which has been proven very profitable for the past 6 years, however, it is no rocket science that current environment is changing. So, I am also looking to switch 40% of my portfolio to alpha-generating assets, that can support my investments during for the time being. Below are my thoughts.

&#x200B;

**Gold** \- My first thought was GOLD:

Since my very early ages I knew gold was a very good diversifier. However, this has started to change and during the latest crash I observed gold falling together with stocks during the first days. My intuition sees two main reasons behind that move:

\- Typical liquidity crunch. Fund managers losing money in equities, have to lower positions elsewhere - similar to the triggering of the ""Quant Meltdown of Aug 2007"".

\- Investors' aggregate perception of gold has changed. As investing has switched away from the traditional allocation strategies and market intervention is now common, investors no longer consider gold to be a safe haven.

&#x200B;

**Alternative funds** \- My second thought was long/short Hedge Funds**:**

I 've had a look into the performance of some Hedge Funds and I have to admit that the majority of them did much better than expected over the past months. In fact 90% of Hedge Fund managers seems to have out-performed the market ([source](https://www.hedgeweek.com/2020/03/30/284305/long-volatility-and-tail-risk-strategies-outshone-their-peers-equities-and-oil)) and many of them actually did very well. My main problem is that as an investor, I would like to diversify the 40% of my portfolio into a few funds, instead of one, which is impossible given the entry tickets these HFs have. I have found a platform that offers market-neutral Hedge Fund portfolios ([Daedalus](https://daedalus.investments)), with very low minimums. I didn't know the funds on the platform before. They have very good performance and actually did pretty well over the past 3 months too. Could this be attributed to their smaller size (I think most of them are <$10 billion)?

&#x200B;

**Other** \- Any other ways/platforms that I can use to access Hedge Funds (like Citadel or Two Sigma) or portfolios of them with low minimums? Any other sources of alpha I can explore instead?"

That makes no sense. Things happened since then. The passage of a $2 trillion relief bill. The significant advancements in testing and vaccines. The unlimited QE/liquidity promised by the Fed. No these things aren't without consequences, but you can't just say inflation is going to get out of control when you have no idea what you're talking about.

Regardless of whether you think those things will fix the whole virus problem (I don't either), you still have to admit the expectation of market value should be higher than it was before those things happened.

2020-03-30,doggopupper4ever,99,The Federal Reserve will slow the pace at which it buys Treasuries under its unlimited quantitative easing program. (It has been at 75 billion dollars PER DAY.),"**My questions are at the end of this post.  Thank you.**

On Bloomberg from 3 days ago:

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Reserve will slow the pace at which it buys Treasuries under its unlimited quantitative easing program.

The U.S. central bank, which has been aggressively purchasing Treasuries for the past two weeks in a bid to offset the economic and market fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, on Friday said that it would dial back the daily pace of buying to $60 billion next Thursday and Friday. It will continue purchasing at the existing pace of $75 billion a day for the first three days of next week.

“This is a more nimble Fed, at least opposed to the earlier QE Fed, because they’re not operating off a rule book -- they’re trying to calibrate the amount needed and retaining flexibility,” said Priya Misra, global head of rates strategy at TD Securities. “The fact that they’re easing into it is a good sign, they’re trying to get more data, the fact they’re giving us a week notice, that’s good.” If $60 billion a day proves too little, Misra said she wouldn’t be surprised to see them increase the amount again.

The central bank announced its return to quantitative easing earlier this month as virus concerns ripped through global markets and the prospects for the global economy cratered. And this past Monday it declared that it would purchase assets “in the amounts needed to support the smooth functioning of markets.” It has bought Treasuries at a steady clip of $75 billion a day since then, although there was some talk in the market that the monetary authority might look to ease back.

They couldn’t buy $75 billion a day forever, so “stepping it back slowly” to $60 billion “makes sense,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies LLC. “They’ve been having a few of the purchases under-subscribed so that’s a sign they don’t have to go full bore.”

At this pace the Fed will have bought almost $1 trillion dollars of Treasuries by end of next week.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------

Original Article: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/fed-set-to-dial-back-pace-of-qe-treasury-buying-next-thursday](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-27/fed-set-to-dial-back-pace-of-qe-treasury-buying-next-thursday)

&#x200B;

Note that the article says the Fed has been buying Treasuries at **75 billion dollars PER DAY** and that the **Fed will have bought almost $1 trillion dollars of Treasuries by the end of the week**.

**Question: Is this a sustainable pace?**  What if it is not?  If it is not sustainable, **when will the Fed stop?**  **What will happen to the treasure yield when the Fed stops buying at this crazy pace?**

**Question: Could someone please give some overall insight on how this will work out, especially with the context of what happens if the Fed stops buying treasuries at 60 to 75 billion dollars per day.**

Italy has threatened to leave the EU if no satisfactory plan is issued.

2) The 2.2 trillion dollars stimulus that the US government has announced is humongous but no one knows if it's going to be sufficient.

Deliveries will undoubtedly be soft, but I think the Street will shrug it off, and look to production and deliveries recovery in 2H after the COVID-19 disruptions.

With the Fremont plant shutdown, Reno plant at 25% capacity, and New York facility now making ventilators, China will be the primary source of revenue for Q2. Analyst checks indicate \~4k vehicles delivered in China during Feb, and \~3k vehicle/week production rate coming out of Q1.

Given the current environment, Q2 revenue from outside China will mainly consist of vehicles already in transit or waiting for delivery (so not much). Street also largely assumes no revenue from ventilator production in NY. Medtronic PB-980 ventilators retail for $32-48k each, so TSLA technically could realize $50-150m of revenue depending on how much/when they start producing."

Like in 2015, this price crash is an obvious temporary reaction to a perfect storm, and crude obviously isn't going to stay at historic lows for long.

1) How is it so long, when the long term value of oil is profoundly unlikely to be permanently damaged

2) If it is indeed rational to invest in Oil long-term at this price, how do I do so? I am UK based if that helps.

All NY bond ratings I have found online are IG. 

Is there a non-neglible risk of default for municipal bonds, in particular NY munis? Does anyone know how they fared in 2007/2008?

Edit: Did some more research and it seems there is indeed [considerable risk in the NY Muni market. ](https://www.crainsnewyork.com/coronavirus/sleepy-municipal-bond-market-goes-dystopian) .

With infinite QE, wouldn't hyperinflation be inevitable once the coronavirus is no more? More money means things will cost more due to inflation. Stocks are currently being inflated and will only get more inflated until you eventually walk into a McDonald's and a burger costs you $300. This causes increase in revenue for McDonald's which means $MCD stock keeps going up and will maintain a higher price.

With Donald Trump's love to keep pushing the market to all time highs every week, $SPY will keep going up. If you had unlimited money and you wanted to invest your money, you would buy stocks now that they are low. Stocks keep pumping higher and higher. I feel like this is happening with all the banks and companies that are using the Fed's 0% interest rates and infinite QE to get ahead of the game.

Right now my total return is -170.00. What happens if I dont wan't to exercise this put at its expiration date?

2020-03-31,ksketo,4,European Coronabond: A moral hazard or the way forward?,"Last week, 9 European countries called for the issuance of so-called coronabonds. These would be a common debt instrument to raise funds in the markets to the benefit of all member states. Those countries would have access to funds to boost spending and lower taxes without increasing their national debt. 

The Germans and the Dutch called the move to coronabonds premature, fearing that a mutualized debt issuance would encourage irresponsible spending.

***The question is, as all member states head into likely recessions, are coronabonds the inevitable process to the sustainability of those countries or a precursor to a future split that will create further tensions and problems?***"
2020-03-30,CielSchwab,53,Moody's cuts outlook on $6.6 trillion US corporate debt pile to 'negative',"Moody’s Investors Service has cut its outlook on corporate debt to negative, saying that an economy about to tip into recession because of the coronavirus will result in rising default rates.

The ratings agency warned that sectors “most sensitive to consumer demand and sentiment” will be especially hard-hit due to social distancing measures that slashed economic activity. They include global passenger airlines, the lodging and cruise industries, and autos.

In addition, plummeting energy prices will leave the oil and gas sector exposed, while banks also will face a challenging environment amid falling interest rates that eat into profitability and a deteriorating economy that will undermine credit quality.

“The coronavirus will cause an unprecedented shock to the global economy,” Edmond DeForest, senior credit officer at Moody’s, said in a report. “We have revised our growth forecasts downward for 2020 as the rising economic costs of the coronavirus shock and the policy responses to combat the downturn are becoming clearer. Business activity will likely fall sharply across advanced economies in the first half of 2020.”



The warnings comes even after the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of saying it would be buying corporate debt as a way to keep liquidity flowing in a market that froze up after the government announced social distancing measures.

While Moody’s said central bank intervention will help, some of the most heavily indebted sectors still will be vulnerable. The Fed’s purchases will be limited to investment-grade companies with strong credit quality.

“Government support will cushion the blow for some companies, but it is unlikely to prevent distress at businesses with less certain long-term viability,” DeForest wrote. 

Nonfinancial corporate debt totaled $6.6 trillion at the end of 2019, a 78% increase since the Great Recession ended in mid-2009. 

Low interest rates and easy financing terms helped fuel the boom. Investor protections known as covenants have been around all-time lows, meaning that some buyers could see big losses in event of defaults.

There also are companies on the borderline of investment grade and in danger of sliding to junk status that are posing risks for the corporate bond market. Goldman Sachs estimates that $765 billion worth of investment- and high-yield bonds have experienced ratings downgrades already in 2020.

DeForest also noted significant refinance risks — some $169 billion of debt will come due in 2020 and $300 billion in 2021 and rolling over that debt will be difficult “under these trying conditions,” DeForest said.

Content:

>The Federal Reserve on Tuesday announced the establishment of a temporary repurchase agreement facility for foreign and international monetary authorities (FIMA Repo Facility) to help support the smooth functioning of financial markets, including the U.S. Treasury market, and thus maintain the supply of credit to U.S. households and businesses. The FIMA Repo Facility will allow FIMA account holders, which consist of central banks and other international monetary authorities with accounts at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to enter into repurchase agreements with the Federal Reserve. In these transactions, FIMA account holders temporarily exchange their U.S. Treasury securities held with the Federal Reserve for U.S. dollars, which can then be made available to institutions in their jurisdictions. This facility should help support the smooth functioning of the U.S. Treasury market by providing an alternative temporary source of U.S. dollars other than sales of securities in the open market. It should also serve, along with the U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines the Federal Reserve has established with other central banks, to help ease strains in global U.S. dollar funding markets.  
>  
>The Federal Reserve provides U.S. dollar-denominated banking services to FIMA account holders in support of Federal Reserve objectives and in recognition of the U.S. dollar's predominant role as an international currency. The FIMA Repo Facility, which adds to the range of services the Federal Reserve provides, will be available beginning April 6 and will continue for at least 6 months.

2020-03-31,_aliased,2,Brookfield Infrastructure ($BIP) Completes Unit Split and Creation of Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation,"Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (“Brookfield Infrastructure” or “BIP”) (NYSE: BIP; TSX: BIP.UN) and Brookfield Infrastructure Corporation (“BIPC”) (NYSE, TSX: BIPC) today jointly announced that Brookfield Infrastructure has completed the previously announced creation of BIPC.  From an economic and accounting perspective, the transaction was analogous to a unit split as the transaction did not result in any underlying change to aggregate cash flows or net asset value except for the adjustment for the number of units/shares outstanding.

“We are excited to be launching this new offering to investors, providing an alternative way to access our globally diversified portfolio of high-quality infrastructure assets,” said Sam Pollock, Chief Executive Officer of Brookfield Infrastructure. “We see many potential benefits in establishing BIPC, including expanding our investor base, broader index inclusion and tax advantages for some investors.”

Each unitholder of record on March 20, 2020 received one (1) class A exchangeable subordinate voting share (the “Share”) of BIPC for every nine (9) BIP units held, or approximately 0.11 Shares for each BIP unit. BIP unitholders now own approximately 32,800,000 Shares, or 70.4% of BIPC’s issued and outstanding Shares, with Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and its affiliates holding 29.6% of the remaining Shares. The Shares have commenced regular-way trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “BIPC”.

**For beneficial unitholders who hold their BIP units in an account with a broker or other intermediary,** their account will be automatically updated to reflect the receipt of the Shares.

2020-03-30,mfyd,51,Why Tanker Stocks are happy about Oil Prices.,"Hello r/investing! I saw someone earlier today ask on how to capitalize on the current oil price and it finally pushed me over the edge to make a post on some findings I have had the past two weeks.

A BIT ABOUT MYSELF:
--
I’ll start by warning you I am not all that experienced in this field. I made it a New Years Resolution to learn and invest more heavily this year, and I began to aggressively dollar cost average in. I felt pretty good until a few weeks ago when suddenly it felt like everything was red and would be for a long time. I felt like I had just stepped up to the poker table, and a shootout broke out in the saloon. While the losses didn’t look good, I saw this as a tremendous opportunity to pick up some chips off the floor in the chaos. Below is my argument for a great deal of those chips on the floor, but I don’t know how longer they will say.


THE PLAY:
-----
Let’s talk about shipping. The past few years the industry has seen bearish waters and much of the sector has consolidated. Environmental regulations have further taken ships off the market. The industry saw a bump in the end of 2019, and this year has been sold off massively the past few weeks. With COVID, dry goods and general shipping is getting slammed. So funds and anything related to shipping was sold off significantly. However, the subset of oil tanker stocks are primed for an absolutely insane year. The market environment and COVID is set to give crude tanker companies the opportunity to profit at a rate unlike they have seen in decades.

THE BULL EVIDENCE:
--------------
**Contango:** The current price of oil is so low, investors know they can buy it at the price it is now, and sell it for a significant profit later. You have to buy it now though, and where are you going to keep it? Oil land storage is set to fill up within weeks, and the most cost efficient method of storing oil is offshore on a tanker (VLCC). However, since the number of VLCCs available has shrank (scrapping, bought by Saudi’s, or even held up due to quarantine delays) it has driven up the rates of these tankers. Where they once were signing contracts for 20k a day they are now regularly in the 100k+ range (even going so high as to 300k a day).

**Tanker/Oil Demand**: Since VLCCs are being taken off the market (both by Saudi’s using them to ship their cheap oil, and storage rates) this is looking to spillover into smaller tankers as well. Afromax and Supramax tankers are getting taken off the books and driving prices upward across the board. With more oil being pumped but demand continuing to go down these tankers are looking to be parked for months. With supplies slowly getting chipped at once demand starts back up again.

**Positive Earnings despite insane selloff:** Every earnings call that I was able to dig up the past two weeks has had an incredible air of positivity to it, which is refreshing given most of the market sentiment. In fact, every call I listened to said they planned on adding to their dividend and initiating stock buyback programs. TNP went so far as to say “And when I said mindboggling, it’s for the whole bunker industry. It’s not, I mean, in our case. It’s because we know -- I mean -- the Company right now -- we are valued almost as much as cash that we're in the bank, which is -- it is very, very cheap. I think it’s a very good investment for us to make.” Find me another industry right now that is talking like this or is as positive forward looking because I see a whole lot of earnings and guidance getting put on hold. The CEO for INSW said ""This is a once-in-a-generation type of event,"" Zabrocky says, noting charterers are starting to book vessels with storage options for periods of more than a year.
 
**Insider Buys**: Insider activity is a lovely indicator as to the general sentiment within an industry. Selling tells you a little, but I think buying tells you a lot. I think when you have buying across the sector, from multiple players it tells you veeery good things. Buying of this sort causes analyists to throw around words that get me hard like “parabolic”




WHY AM I TELLING YOU THIS:
--------------
Well frankly, I have maxed out my position on this play already. Anything else and I am digging into margin (personal no-no), and I have already thus far seen significant gains while still believing there are more to be made. It is my opinion there are at least a dollar worth of earnings the next year being sold for a quarter. Most of these guys cargo rates are spiking 10x compared to last year.


 I have also found nothing but bullish articles and arguments for my position and I am hoping to perhaps find a bearish one among you out there who have more experience than a guy bored at his computer all day. Since I have been in quarantine, I have felt slightly insane researching a sector I once hardly knew about that none of my friends have any interest in. I am hoping to engage in some interesting discussion with you folk here. Call me an idiot, just tell me why. Here to learn and find better way to do things.

2020-03-31,Heco1331,1,Implied carry spread on Oil futures (crazy rates),"Hi guys,

I've been checking the implied rates in oil futures for the last days and they seem to have gone crazy. At the moment of writing these lines these are the prices for the spot and the front 3 months:

* Spot = 20.4
* May  Future = 20.54
* Jun Future = 24.52
* Jul Future = 27.71

The implied carry rates I calculate for each one of these futures are \[12.5%, 153.6%, 163.5%\]. First of all , these rates are crazy (ignoring the May one). Second, I think a May-June calendar spread until the May Expiration (20th of April) should be pretty profitable. There is a chance they keep the absolute difference between future prices constant (hence the trade wouldn't be profitable) but if so, the June Future impliedrate on the 20th of April would be 263% which is even crazier...

&#x200B;

If you know what your companies are worth then buy when they hit targets. Quit worrying about the fabled bottom or the inevitable rebound. 

Of course, if you’re trading intraday or swing style, may the Force be with you. You’re gonna need it. Follow your strategy, don’t get FOMO, and stay disciplined. It’s just another day. Good luck to everyone. This is a great opportunity."

So we've got a more a more official move towards a possible deal or cooperation in the oil markets.  Again this is early and it's tough tough to say if anything will come of it, but the fact that Putin is stepping in here on the side of a potential deal bodes well.  It's also been speculated that half of the reason that Russia nixed the prior deal in the first place was because of US sanctions, so that's something that might come up again.

These are slow steps and today was another big day down for oil, but hopefully this is a beginning of a new deal to help cut production until the worst of the virus passes.

I think it's unlikely the market ends up totally balance here but the chances of avoid production hikes and getting some cuts seem to be a bit better than they were after the last OPEC+ deal fell apart."

2020-03-31,cookingboy,0,"I predicted the economic impact 2 months ago, and now I'm cautiously optimistic about a fast recovery.","Due to being at the wrong place at the wrong time, I managed to predict a lot of the economic impact of the virus in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eusz3g/people_arent_fully_realizing_the_economic_impact/) 2 months ago. However reality turned out to be even worse than what I expected because I did not predict most of the Western governments would be sitting around doing almost nothing for six weeks while the public made memes of ""beer flu"" and threw ""quarantine parties"". 

I've been following the the whole situation worldwide carefully ever since, so much so that I'm now a mod on /r/coronavirus. For the first time in weeks I'm starting to feel a fast recovery is on the horizon, and it will happen to the stock market first before the economy itself. 

Here are some of the reasons why I am cautiously optimistic now:

1. Containment/mitigation measures work, and they work fast. Even if you discard China's number peaking a couple weeks ago because their government doesn't have the best credibility, we are seeing similar trend in South Korea, Italy, Singapore and Taiwan after good measures are put in place. Despite the initial delayed response and the late lock down, Italy's new case numbers are finally coming down, following a similar trend/timeline as China's official numbers. The rest of Western Europe is a few weeks behind Italy, but I forecast similar results. Meanwhile the situation in America will get much worse and drag on longer due to lack of centralized response (some States are still not taking this seriously) and the beautiful [American spirit](https://www.newsweek.com/large-crowds-ignore-social-distancing-guidelines-watch-navy-hospital-ship-dock-nyc-amid-1495154), but it's a matter of time before the situation improves here as well.

2. The second angle is from human psychology. Human beings are amazingly adaptive and have the intrinsic tendency/self-defense mechanism to remain optimistic in the face of odds. Once the shock and fear is over, the general public will potentially treat mask wearing and crowded hospitals as the new norm, and will try their best to get back to their old lives. We are seeing some reports of this in China already, from both individual accounts and news reports. There is a lot of pent up demand, frustration, and most importantly *cash* amongst Chinese consumers at the moment and some of my family in Shanghai are telling me malls are once again busy and crowded with mask wearing shoppers. There is strong hope for similar outcome in other countries. 
It is also precisely due to human psychology, general public's risk tolerance will be able to stomach the virus as soon as containment measure slows the spread down enough to alleviate pressure on our healthcare system. We won't wait for the vaccine. We won't wait for zero new case count. If Trump is right about one thing, it is ""America isn't built for quarantine"". 

3. Due to greed and tendency to remain optimistic, the stock market will recover even before the economy does. We are past the initial shock phase, and once more and more countries start showing the same case trend as Italy, South Korea and China, more and more people will be basing their outlook on that future. The market tends to be laggy when it comes to responding to bad events, but tend to be leading before actual concrete good news. Hope is a powerful drug and a two sided sword.

In the end, I'm predicting market volatility for the next few weeks, and economic activity being severely impacted for the next 2 months, but we'll see recovery beginning Jun and I wouldn't be surprised if the market recovers close to ATH sometimes in the 3rd quarter. 

**The big risk to my prediction**: I am going to use an analogy here. If we compare this crisis vs. the 2008 recession. This time it's like the economy got shot in the stomach by a rifle round, and 2008 was the doctor telling the economy it had a malign stomach tumor that doesn't look good. A bullet wound is so much scarier at first, a lot bloodier, and hurts a lot more. But given good emergency treatment, its long term prognosis is a lot better than cancer. The treatment plan for a bullet wound is also a lot more clear and effective than whatever treatment we have for cancer that can't be easily operated on.

Now that is with the assumption the bullet didn't hit any vital organs. That is the major risk I'm worried about. Will there be serious underlying issues being uncovered during this period that reveals that the economic had a tumor all along? Some people say it's corporate debt, some people say it's healthcare cost and lack of social safety net. I don't know, and if we discover something like that, that is when the aforementioned hope instantly turn into despair and we'd be looking at a second round of sell off and panic reaction that is much, much worse than what happened so far."

The main thing keeping markets afloat are asset managers rebalancing their portfolios and spending new cash on equities. This will last until the end of the month before things start heading lower. 

There’s about $850 Billion in inflows heading into the market. I’m not sure how much of it has already entered the market, but I know that a lot of managers will get cash on March 31, and spend it on April 1. So there’s still a couple more days of 2% up/down days and generally muted volatility. 

If you’re into trading options now would be a good time to buy Puts while volatility is relatively low. We’ve got a lot of manufacturing data, jobs reports, and other economic data in the next couple of days that should drag the market back down.

You can recontribute a CVD back into your IRA within three years of the withdrawal date and treat the withdrawal and later recontribution as a totally tax-free rollover.""

""In effect, the CVD drill allows you to borrow up to $100,000 from your IRA(s) and repay the amount(s) any time up to three years later with no federal income tax consequences. And there are no limitations on what you can use CVD funds for during the three-year period.""

If you're not familiar with CLOs you should read this great article on that goes into a fair amount fo detail: [https://www.naic.org/capital\_markets\_archive/primer\_180821.pdf](https://www.naic.org/capital_markets_archive/primer_180821.pdf)

From my point of view, it's the CDOs of 2008, except, instead of mortgages, it's corporate debt. Where does this come back to bite us? How exposed are the banks? How big is the market? Apparently, early 2019 estimations put the CLO exposure at $1.4T worldwide. However, recent independent examinations put the market at $1.8T in the U.S. alone. From what I understand, corporations that are too risky or too crappy to get a regular investment-grade loan, or even perhaps a junk loan, are still given loans (called leverage loans), with extremely high-interest rates. However, no lender, not even with high-interest payments, wants to hold on to this stuff. So they package a bunch of them together into SPVs called CLOs, and sell them off. Now, who owns them is also a bit of confusion to me but if anyone on here can answer the following questions that would be great.

&#x200B;

1) How to track them/ Where to find more information on what's inside

2) How exposed are the banks (re-packaging side)

My take:

He was a beneficiary of the gradual financialization of the economy. After the 70s, financial markets became the most important gauge of economic health and wealth. Thus, those who were well positioned within that industry gained tremendously. 

The Dow and S&P were always an afterthought to inflation and unemployment in past time. from the 80s on, they had to be saved at all cost. Meanwhile, we lost most of our industries and slid competitively with the world. Remember, Berkshire is mostly invested in Finance and insurances.

Surely the market will be up and down...but this covid-19 stuff is overblown right? Low fatality rate and that huge stimulus bill! Markets will rebound in 6 months and we'll all laugh at how silly that selloff was. Then it hit me between the eyes, no way. Medical Reports are coming out that asymptomatic carriers are not 1-3% but closer to 15% of infected. These people will continue like nothing is wrong and have such a small chance of being reported. China is vastly under reporting cases according to British reports, to the order of 15~40X the number. It's become political, look at the glorious communist party's response. Odd that the US jumped to first place right? Yeah because we are actually reporting somewhat accurately. Iran's rate is likely completely out of control, as will most of the 3rd world's be. You have millions and millions of people who live in 200 sq ft. room with a dozen people sleeping on the floor. They can't access a toilet but somehow we can stop Covid-19? To focus on the States, you have millions upon millions of people basically frozen from earning money. It's insane to think people are just gonna start 'going out' and spending money even if the government says it's under control again. They won't. The spread will slow yes, but it will still spread. The economy can't slow this hard for 3-4-5 months and that 1200 check will cover about 2 months for the most essential stuff for most. Housing prices are gonna tank, how could the bank approve a mortgage if your income is tied to anything remotely customer related? No way this isn't leading to a major major recession or depression. I could go on and on but people saying ""well in 2008 blah blah blah"" that's a man made recession, this is a pandemic from nature. It's apple and oranges. In 2008 whole cities are not locked in place, this pandemic is not 'bad assets' on a balance sheet. No way is this going away quickly and we will knee jerk our way through the whole thing fighting nature. Sorry to rant but this isn't something that has a nice 'bow' the government can fix by handing the banks a check. The media will keep churning that panic and people are not gonna go out for months and months and months. No way this isn't gonna get worse."

Similar to that, how do you think simply confirmation of a vaccination will impact the markets? I'm curious because simply because one has been found, doesn't mean that the general public will have access to it for at least 12 to 18 months.

U. S. stock futures turned around early Monday morning and edged higher in volatile trading after last week’s sharp gains, even as the number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. continues to rise at an alarming rate.

Earlier, futures had pointed to an implied opening drop of more than 300 points for the Dow.


At around 1:00 a.m. ET, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were up 132 points, pointing to an implied rise of about 59 points at the Monday open. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures also pointed to a slightly higher opening for Monday. The moves came as crude prices fell sharply. 

The Dow last week posted its biggest weekly gain since 1938, surging more than 12%. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are coming off their best week since 2009, after rising 10.3% and 9.1%, respectively. To be sure, it was a volatile ride for investors. The S&P 500 posted daily swings of at least 2.9% in four of the five sessions. That includes a 3.4% drop on Friday for the S&P 500.

CH 20200326 Stock market wild swings 10am.png
The sharp gains last week were sparked in part by the prospect of massive fiscal and monetary stimulus. President Donald Trump signed into law Friday a $2 trillion stimulus package that includes direct payments to curb the economic blow from the outbreak. The Federal Reserve also launched a series of measures to sustain the economy, including an open-ended asset-purchase program.

“Bulls staged an epic comeback,” said Ken Berman, strategist at Gorilla Trades. “Despite the rally … the uncertainty regarding the length of the necessary, but economically damaging global lockdowns continues to weigh on risk assets.”

“The technical picture continues to be bearish across the board, despite the mid-week surge in stocks, with all of the key trend indicators still pointing lower,” said Berman, noting the major averages are still below their respective moving-day averages even after last week’s strong gains. 

Coronavirus cases around the world are still climbing, adding to the uncertainty over when lockdown and quarantine measures will be removed and the economy can return to normal.

Data compiled by Johns Hopkins University shows more than 713,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed globally. The U.S. overtook Italy and China last week as the country with the most cases with over 136,000. Nearly half of all U.S. cases come from New York, where more than 59,000 people have been infected.

“Equity markets are overextended, but face a bumpy period of even grimmer virus news and poor economic statistics in the next 1-2 months,” strategists at MRB Partners wrote in a note. “The world is now entering a third phase, the first being the shock of an out-of-control virus spreading around the globe, then the massive policy response, and now the economic fallout phase has arrived and will test investors’ very fragile confidence.”

Investors got a glimpse of the virus’ economic impact last week. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported a record 3.28 million workers filed for unemployment benefits the week of March 20. That number easily topped the previous record of 695,000 set in 1982. U.S. consumer sentiment also fell to its lowest level in more than three years.

To be sure, the market has also flashed some signals of a potential bottom. The confidence spread between the so-called smart money — large institutions — and dumb money, retail investors, sits squarely in positive territory after dropping to extremely low levels. Meanwhile, insider buying reached an 11-year high.

President Donald Trump also extended at a news conference Sunday the national social distancing guidelines to April 30 and said the death rate would peak in two weeks.

I'm afraid same thing is happening this time. All the long-term passive investors convinced themselves that the market will fall farther. And when you genuinely believe that the market will fall farther, it's really really hard to not sell your investments. The ones who shouted ""Just buy every two weeks with paycheque and never sell"" were shocked by the 30% drop that they sold the moment the market rebounded 15%. Now they are shitting their pants on whether they missed the train."

2020-03-30,Enigma_7201,5,Aren't we in a deflationary period?,"The more the Fed keeps printing money, the less impact it actually has. After the 2 major rate cuts, markets dove. This leads me to the question, is this economic environment inflationary or deflationary? My first instinct along with many other I believe is to deem the current environment as inflationary. I was on that train before corona but once the virus hit, I'm convinced we are heading for deflation. I don't expect this to last a while but it will definitely do damage to business.

My evidence for my claim is how low demand for things are. Services are extremely cheap. A Jet Blue flight to Vegas is $18. Things like hotels and flights are so cheap I'm convinced that the companies are losing lots just by continuing operations. The effect of this is that the dollar has strengthened. Big banks and companies like Apple are sitting on huge piles of cash. These companies choosing to not spend is troubling. The U.S. consumer is also nowhere to be found; furthermore, people only want food, toilet paper and hand sanitizer. This increase in the dollar has created the inverse affect in gold. We saw gold diving but has rebounded strongly since. The correlation between the dollar and gold however has been lost a bit. In the initial dive in stocks, everything was selling off and people rushed to find liquidity in whatever markets the could find. I wouldn't be surprised if the dollar jumps even more triggering a sell of in gold. For the Fed, they will need to anticipate this jump in the dollar and suppress the currency. Then gold will get its chance to shine. 

This is all a theory and I encourage whoever is reading this to either offer more evidence supporting my claim or to disapprove it."

2020-03-29,richards_david,542,How long will the Covid-19 affect the markets? How should everyday investors react?,"Let’s see how the current environment looks like.

&#x200B;

Here are **some uncertainties** that govern investors’ reactions over the past 50 days:

* Nobody knows how long will the pandemic last. Obviously, the longer the worse and there is no indication of slowing down.
* Nobody knows if people who get sick will have immunity over the next potential virus wave.
* Nobody knows how the transition period back to normal economic activity will be achieved and how long it will take.
* Nobody can estimate the real economic damage to the backbone of the economy → SMEs
* Nobody can estimate the second derivative of the sell-off effects, i.e. what will happen with the fallen angels and lack of liquidity.

&#x200B;

**A few facts about the virus:**

* Death rate varies between 0.5% – 7%, depending on population age, ICU coverage and extent of population testing.
* Most of the patients do not present symptoms for many days, which makes the virus extremely effective in spreading.
* No vaccine is expected before the next 12–16 months.

&#x200B;

**Now, a few economic facts and hard data:**

* Almost 50% of US corporate debt is BBB rated now and with most of the world’s population being under lock-down, it is no rocket science that big part of them will fall below investment grade.
* Almost 3.3M Americans filed for jobless claims last week. This is 5x the previous record of 1982.
* The Fed’s balance sheet just exceeded $5 trillion for the first time.
* Markets are deep into bear market territories.

&#x200B;

**The Covid-19 effect:**

Now, it is important to clarify that Coronavirus will not disappear overnight. It will be a long and gradual process lasting 3–6 months. I am afraid the worse is yet to come for markets across the world. The detrimental effects in the real economy are becoming more obvious day by day and translated into spikes in unemployment, mortgage payment delays, lack of liquidity and financing for SMEs, cuts in Capex and supplies, and lastly corporate and personal defaults. This is a self-feeding loop probably leading to what economists describe as secular stagnation.

The Central Banks were not ready to face such a crisis. Rates were extremely low already and their balance sheets were already loaded with a lot of public and corporate debt. Another stimulus plan may be the only solution now, but it is not sustainable in the long run.

My opinion is that markets will remain into bearish territory for many months after the “end of Covid-19”.

&#x200B;

**What can ordinary investors do to prepare?**

1. **You cannot time the market**. You never could and definitely cannot start now. So, instead of guessing whether stock markets are going to rise or fall further after Covid-19, adopt a longer horizon. Get some exposure in the stock market but do it for the long run. There is no point to pick the best mutual fund, as most of them underperform the markets. Go for a cheap ETF. Robinhood or Vanguard will probably do for most jurisdictions.
2. **Normal diversifiers** like corporate bonds are always necessary for an all-weather portfolio. However, keep in mind that in every liquidity crunch most of the risky assets move together and move downwards.
3. **Safe havens**, like government bonds (US, Germany, UK) still have their place in your portfolio.
4. **Look for market-neutral alternatives**. This can be alternative types of exposure, investment styles, methods, etc. Look for market-neutral assets and funds. At the toughest periods, the market-neutral investments will keep your portfolio beating. It is true that market-neutral exposure is not the easiest thing to achieve as an ordinary investor, but there are a few apps that try to achieve that. I find Daedalus Investment Platform interesting, but I am sure there will be others as well for jurisdictions not covered.
5. **Keep some cash**. Not only as a safe haven but to also exploit opportunities when you identify them.

&#x200B;

**Summary**: These are hard times for the markets and events that are unprecedented for our generation. It is and will be tough, but the best we can do is be prepared both for the virus (social distancing & healthy routine) and for our long-run financial plan."
2020-03-30,TikiB,1,March 30 Analysis - Review by a Canadian,"I thought I would give my take on what I saw today and what I am watching for tomorrow.

Canadian Oil companies changing the trend - I talked before how I suspect CPG - crescent point energy, was developing an [inverse head and shoulders pattern](https://www.tradingview.com/x/2qilRpA2/).   Today I also noted that SU - suncor energy and CNQ - Canadian Natural Resources had big days (up 15% and 18%).  All 3 names are looking for their first bullish trend change since the drop with CNQ right on the door followed by SU and CPG.  It will be short term bullish if they break tomorrow.

Gold Miners - BTO - B2Gold Corp; ELD - Eldorado Gold; YRI - Yamana Gold, K - kinross gold - all first broke hourly uptrend and now their 4 hour uptrend.  Now we look for the daily.  I suspect they will hold daily uptrend given how hard they bounced.  If they fall another 5% tomorrow, I would begin to look at scaling in for a bounce and then play range.

CGC/WEED - I thought this needed major daily consolidation after how much it bounced off bottom.  Yet it has only pulled back 5% in two days.  I believe SPY being strong has helped.  If SPY remains bullish we could see test of top from 2 days ago, weakness and I believe consolidation will be underway.

Other notes - BBD.B - Bombardier gave back 2 days of bounces in 2 days.  Support is multiple daily supports up to $0.38.  Worth trying for a bottom fishing play with a tight stop.

AC- Air Canada holding similar path of WEED, big bounce off bottom and not too bad of a 2 day pullback.  It's one that I will watch and only play if it breaks bearish and heads towards low."

The global economic picture is looking bleak, with recessions in almost every developed economy across the world. We assume that there will be a recovery in the second half of the year,"" said Agathe Demarais, Global Forecasting Director, EIU.

Even as the Indian economy is likely to be battered by the Coronavirus pandemic this year, it is still likely to be better off than all other G20 countries. The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) in its post-Covid-19-outbreak revised growth forecast for G20 countries in 2020 downgraded projected FY21 GDP growth of India to 2.1 per cent from 6 per cent before the outbreak. While this looked like a free fall but when compared to other G20 countries, India’s growth projection stood on the top while others are set to dive deep into recession except for two other countries – China and Indonesia.

While India will be the fastest-growing this year at 2.1 per cent, China and Indonesia will grow at 1 per cent in 2020, EIU forecast said. “The global economic picture is looking bleak, with recessions in almost every developed economy across the world. We assume that there will be a recovery in the second half of the year, but downside risks to this baseline scenario are extremely high, as the emergence of second, or third waves of the epidemic would sink growth further,” said Agathe Demarais, Global Forecasting Director, EIU in the forecast update on its website."

2020-03-30,sharsenij14,3,Learning to trade on margin (please help),"Hi everyone. I am testing out a systematic, cash-neutral, long/short strategy in a paper trading account with Interactive Brokers. Each day, an algorithm tells me what my target portfolio should look like in terms of relative position sizes. So, I multiply these target percent positions by 97% of my account value to yield target dollars amounts. I then divide these dollar amounts by the last close in order to get the target number of shares, take a difference between my currently held positions and these target positions (in shares), and send the corresponding orders to the broker. The problem is that I constantly run out of Excess Liquidity when I try to place these orders (i.e. I exceed my maintenance margin). This happens even though my account value generally does not move by more than 0.5% in a day (it is a diversified, cash neutral portfolio). Do I hit the margin limit because the short half of my portfolio grows faster when I place these orders (i.e. the short sells go through before the long buys), and the maintenance margin increases? If so what would be the way to counteract it? Should I wait for the buy orders to go through before placing the sell orders? Or should I try keeping more cash in reserve, i.e. target positions to 90% of account value instead of 95-97%? Or am I completely off base and the problem is elsewhere? Any advice would be appreciated. Thank you.

UPDATE: The mystery has been solved. For most of the names I trade, my broker (IB) happens to have a special margin requirement of 100%, which effectively reduces the account's excess liquidity to 0."
2020-03-30,MemoryOfThatDay,15,Why is paying tax later better than now?,"""The archetypal wonderful company—think See’s Candies—grows with minimal incremental reinvestment, compounding the intrinsic value at a high rate while paying out most earnings. Provided that the business continues to earn returns in excess of the required rate of return and sustain its competitive advantage, investors are rewarded for holding wonderful companies for long periods or, as Buffett quips, “[W]hen we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.” 

This allows the investment to compound without paying capital gains tax and is one of the main reasons that wonderful companies appear to be such attractive investment opportunities.""

This reminds me of the advice to look for stocks that gives low dividends because once its paid out gains taxes must be paid, and this is thus undesirable because it takes the decision of "" when to pay tax"" away from the investor.

I imagine one of the reasons is expectations of a lower tax future.

Other reasons might be: how earnings turned into dividends are not used for reinvestment/research, how dividends might inflate the stock price and the reverse and from behavioral : how abundance of capital create inefficiencies;it makes management less careful with expenditures, etc.

But in practice, do any of these factors matter?"

2020-03-31,jeff_varszegi,0,Now is NOT the time for ETFs. Pick high-dividend stocks instead,"**ETA: Please read title as ""... index ETFS..."". ETFs are generally good for diversification; index ETFs are simply weak in a sideways market, where dividend-yielding assets can shine.**

**TL;DR**

* **Although they're thus far a safe investment strategy for the long term, index ETFs perform poorly during a downturn because they unavoidably capture an entire dip and don't recover fully until the index does**

* **Better efficiency toward an investment goal can be achieved by picking winning stocks, especially during a downturn**

* **During a sideways, volatile market, purchasing safe, share-price-depressed dividend stocks can allow excellent growth (especially with DRIP)**

* **There are safer dividend stocks today that also offer tremendous price upside (equal to or greater than index ETFs), making them an excellent bet right now**

* **This requires a shift away from an index-ETF-only mindset**

To recap, ETFs have these characteristics:

1. Lower fees than actively managed funds

2. Historically higher performance than many actively managed mutual funds

3. Poor performance during downturns

ETFs are an easy way to diversify. But it's incredibly easy to beat them, especially now. For someone who actively invests, ETFs are a subpar investing strategy presently *especially* since we are likely in for an extended stretch of market volatility.

Instead, pick solid high-dividend stocks in defensive sectors like healthcare. Pick companies with strong balance sheets, earnings and growth, positioned to survive the downturn. 

For those new to REITs and BDCs, here are some brief tips: 

* Defensive REITs available include healthcare, government and others.

* Debt ratio for an REIT or BDC can look different because of how they're required to operate; read up and don't be afraid, just arm yourself with knowledge about each company you buy.

* REITs which feature ""triple-net"" leases (ones where the tenant pays for taxes, insurance and maintenance) are lower-risk in general, and tend to be very well-positioned to survive the downturn due to longer lease periods. 

* Avoid mREITs for now unless you really know what you're doing.

* Again, stay away from REIT ETFs. Not only do they tend to feature low yields, their diversification patterns may entail extra risks in the current economy, plus there's no reason to suffer any extra fees.

* Consider enrolling in DRIP (dividend reinvestment plan), especially if trading in an IRA without tax implications; if taxes are a worry, reinvest manually with after-tax dividend earnings, allowing balancing as you go

**The longer a horizontal market persists, the more a high-dividend strategy will pull away long-term.** For those unfamiliar with the concept, run numbers through a dividend-yield calculator and be astonished at what you can accomplish starting with 12-18% yields right now. 

Price-depressed dividend-paying stocks are like a fast-growing field of tulips. Buying blue-chip stocks with hardly any price upside is foolish in this market--but buying ETFs is a conscious decision to avoid higher returns."

In theory the value of gold should rise with inflation or possibly surpass it. Now say you want to cash out this money for much more of the inflated currency and dig it out of your backyard. Now what the fuck do you do with it? You can't just go peddle gold bars to Joe Schmoe in the mall. If you go to some ""we buy gold"" place you'll get schlonged with fees and they won't buy at value because they want to resell it too. You're basically stuck with a bunch of heavy metal.

2020-03-29,jedisneverdie,54,Economy not as strong as it seemed,"If you've been reading any of my posts, this has been my line of thinking, for many years now actually. The beginning of this article has a few good tidbits about the size of the problem.

[https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/28/recession-economy-coronavirus/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/28/recession-economy-coronavirus/)

""In  hindsight, however, the economy had blemishes. The record-high stock  prices the president routinely touted became disconnected from  companies’ underlying value, obscuring warning signs such as excessive  borrowing, according to economist Michalis Nikiforos of the Levy  Economics Institute of Bard College. Total [corporate debt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/10/coronavirus-markets-economy-corporate-debt/?tid=lk_inline_manual_12&itid=lk_inline_manual_12) surged past $10 trillion, equal to nearly one-half the nation’s annual output.

“This  shock does not come at a time when the economy is otherwise healthy,”  he said. “There are very significant fragilities in the U.S. economy and  elsewhere.”

On  the eve of the crisis, one-quarter of the country’s largest companies  had more cash going out than coming in, according to Goldman Sachs. The  economic shutdown will quickly cause the share of American companies  that are cash-flow negative to nearly double, meaning they could be in  danger of starving for funds.""

No one has a crystal ball and will know how exactly all this will play out, but don't be in a rush to take a position one way or another. If things truly are, or will become, as bad as some say, we could have a downward trajectory for a few years. It's very early in the process."

I am interested in writing puts on margin and just wanted to make sure I understand the difference between level 2 and level 3 for TDA. 

With level 2, I can use my margin to write puts, but it reduces my buying power 100%?

With level 3, I can write naked puts on margin, and it will only reduce my buying power by around 20%?

Also, with either level I would pay no interest on using margin since I am writing puts, correct?

2020-03-29,CautiousInvestor,32,"Tech has shown incredible resilience in this crisis. Even at these prices, is it still underpriced?","The US is undergoing an unprecedented crisis. People are confined to their homes in much of the country, including economic centers like New York and California.

Through all of this, the technology sector has shown unparalleled resilience. While most physical, non-tech businesses are suffering massive productivity losses, tech was able to shift to fully remote work with remarkable ease.

Moreover, and more importantly, its business showed enviable resistance to the pandemic's devastating effects. Most other sectors: physical retail, travel, hospitality, restaurants, energy, and more - were completely devastated, seeing revenues dropping sharply, sometimes approaching zero. Tech, meanwhile, are largely selling their products and services just as before. Customers are able to access all these products and services regardless of the pandemic. In fact, they are more likely to access them, because these products and services are **online** and most people are currently confined to their homes.

An obvious example is Amazon: while physical retail is dead in the water, Amazon is flooded with orders.

But let's not focus on the very specific circumstances of this particular current crisis, and look towards the longer term. The impressive fact is not that tech survived COVID with minimal damage, but that it seems like it could survive anything you'd throw at it.

Tech workers can produce goods and services of incredible value while working from any set of physical locations, which can be arbitrarily and fully distributed. These goods and services can be consumed by customers anywhere around the world, regardless of their physical state or location, as long as they have internet access.

Think of all the crises our planet is likely to endure as our environment deteriorates and becomes less hospitable: global warming, massive fires, floods, storms, earthquakes, tsunamis. Tech is resilient to all that.

Even without these major disasters, as our climate conditions drift further out of the human comfort zone, people may leave their homes less. That means they'll spend more time online, consuming and even depending upon technology goods and services.

Add to that the fact that the remote work trend just got a massive boost, and we are quite possibly looking at a changing socio-physical environment:

An environment in which most of us work from home, and spend more time at home, generally. Physical human interaction is largely and increasingly abandoned in favor of online interaction, mediated by technology services. In fact, our whole lives, including most of the products and services we consume, would be online and technology-driven.

All of that means tech becomes not just the most important sector: it may become _the only_ sector.

Already, tech companies dominate the top of the S&P500. Practically every traditional company is scrambling to convert itself into a tech company in order to survive, e.g. Walmart Labs.

In a decade or two, the idea of a company that is _not_ a technology company may become entirely obsolete."

2020-03-29,Finance_QuestionsTA,7,Avoiding Foul Play in an Investment Club,"My friend and I want to create an investing club. We already created our LLC, and we're both listed as managers of the LLC. We plan to proceed with 50/50 ownership. I trust him 100%, and he trusts me 100%, but in order to give ourselves and all of our members complete peace of mind that their money is safe, what can we do to ensure there is no foul play? 

I've read a bit about the Financial Fraud Enforcement Task Force, and it seems like it exists to hold scammers accountable in the types of situations that I fear. But we never want to get to that point. We want to completely prevent any financial scams, and know with 100% certainty that our money as well as our club members' money is always safe and withdrawable in the amounts that correspond with the contributions. For example: say I contribute $10,000 into the fund, I want the ONLY risk to my money to be the volatility of our underlying investments, and for it to NEVER be at risk from the people involved. In that example, with 50/50 ownership of the LLC, would my friend have the same access I do to that $10,000? 

If we are listed as the only 2 managers, how can we legally keep track of each member's % ownership of the fund? Another example: my friend's dad is very interested in contributing a large sum to the investment club account, but he is thinking about a worst case scenario where he passes away and his son does not have full ownership of that money. I'm sure my parents and other members would have similar concerns about varying scenarios.

IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said the 189-nation lending agency was forecasting a recovery in 2021, saying it could be a “sizable rebound.” But she said this would only occur if nations succeed in containing the coronavirus and limiting the economic damage.

“A key concern about a long-lasting impact of the sudden stop of the world economy is the risk of a wave of bankruptcies and layoffs that not only can undermine the recovery but erode the fabric of our societies,” she told reporters at a news conference following a telephone conference with finance officials from the 24 nations that make up the IMF’s policy-setting panel.

She said the IMF was updating its economic outlook now and it would be released in a few weeks, allowing the agency more time to assess the economic impacts of the virus.

Asked if the United States was now in recession, she noted that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell had said Thursday that America “ may well be in a recession.” She said she believed not only the United States but many other advanced economies and a number of developing countries had already entered downturns.

Georgieva said lower income countries were being hit hard by the spreading coronavirus, with 81 nations now seeking support from an IMF emergency financing program being used to provide aid.

There is so much unknown right now and the resulting volatility seems to be a gift? Buy it all the way down, and then sell once you can turn a profit. Repeat.

The St. Louis Fed has an amazing database, called FRED, that allows you to easily pull all kinds of economic data and graph it. Here is a little diddy that shows the impact of a low/zero interest rate policy over the last 2 decades. It shows GDP, Fed Debt, and Fed Funds. I had to change the scale of Fed debt to make it match that of GDP, so the text of the scale looks odd.

Notice how starting around 2001 the cheap money policies started as an effort to offset the dotcom bubble bust. Then they unfortunately have continued ever since, albeit more extreme. Notice how Fed debt started increasing materially following the dotcom bust and skyrocketed following the housing bust and hasn't looked back.

At the beginning of 2001, GDP was around $11 trillion and Fed debt around $6 trillion (rounding up). Today GDP is around $22 trillion and Fed debt is around $23 trillion. So for $17 trillion in debt growth, just at the federal level, we've gotten $11 trillion in GDP growth over the last 20 some odd years. Make of it what you will."

Here's my Moneyfarm experience from May 2017 to today. It's a five-minute read, tops and will hopefully provide some inspiration! Enjoy.

I’ve dabbled with investments since the first day I was allowed, buying regularly, selling regularly, trying to time the market and following the news constantly. Eventually I got to the stage where I realised that, through my experiences and results, I was missing something.

I began reading widely online and in broadsheet money supplements. Teeming over Key Investment Documents, fund overviews and balance sheets, repeatedly I began to find clues to the secrets of successful investment. I boiled them down to three key rules:

• Invest regularly, with each pay day  
• Ignore volatility  
• It’s worth paying someone whose sole job is to care for your portfolio (within reason)

Armed with my new investment strategy, I began hunting for someone I could trust to pay to look after my portfolio.

In 2017 I found an article in the Times money supplement about emerging robo-investment platforms. These are companies with reduced overheads allowing for mega low fees (my fee is currently 0.68%). They achieve this by making an online offering only and by basing their funds on Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). Without going into too much detail, which would take a whole separate article, these are ‘baskets’ of hundreds of companies which can be traded as if they’re a single company. This makes them wonderfully cheap and provides investors with great exposure, reducing risk.

Liking the sound of the wealth of their experience, strategy and low fees, I took the Moneyfarm plunge in May 2017.

As of today, my portfolio is just over 12% in the red. But I am extremely happy.

Before the latest pandemic induced slump, my portfolio was pushing through 26%. There have been many ups and downs over my three years with Moneyfarm but remembering my new found rules, I have seen that key to a proper long-term high-risk investment comes high volatility. Time in the market is powerful, this current downturn is essential to future value.

What if you were nervous about current market conditions? From time-to-time I’ve had cause to call one of the advisors to discuss a part of my investment or global events. They have always responded quickly with a personal phone call. The staff are knowledgeable, pragmatic and professional and have made all the time that I needed to talk through situations to my satisfaction.

Some numbers: to date, I have paid out £92.15 in fees. Over the same period, my dividends have brought in £536.82."

2020-03-29,LogicalTranquility,40,Am I crazy for thinking the stocks will not go much more down.,"I get all the arguments as to why the stocks are going to tank ... explosion in number of unemployed, world economy coming to a stand still, etc etc.

However, here is why I think the stocks are going to not tank much. Where will people park their money? Of all the option CDs, Cash, Gold/Silver, Real Estate and Stocks I still think stocks are the most attractive option. With the recent dip, some of the evaluations are starting to look very attractive. Since 2009 the Fed has pumped pushed so much money in the system. That money hasn't dissipated into thin air. It's still waiting to get re-invested.

So yes, while I do believe the market will dip in the short term, I don't think it will dip a whole lot.... just coz there aren't too many better options out there. Thoughts..."
2020-03-29,ProPCGaming,2,"First time investing, maybe a stupid question","Hello all! Currently a college student, and I've been wanting to invest for years but was always afraid to, and I never really had anything to put in. I now find myself with a couple hundred that I'm not going to need in the future, and I think now is a good time to get my feet wet (maybe). Through the bit of research I've done it seems robo-advisors are the way to go for me. I made an account on Betterment, and it gave me a 90%/10% split between stocks/bonds respectively. I took the portfolio Betterment gave me and was going to try and use it myself on Ameritrade (not a roboadvisor but trying to avoid the management fees). I realized I probably can't buy part of a share, so my 200 dollars isn't going to get anywhere close to Betterment's portfolio.

My question is, how does Betterment do this then? How are they able to split my measly 200 bucks into the different funds when even buying just one share of each would cost upwards of 600-700 bucks. Also if anyone has a roboadvisor with cheaper fees that would in theory perform as good or better than Betterment, please don't hold back."

2020-03-28,Diablo24Ever,41,"During uncertainty, stick to your plan!","A big reason for this post is to reaffirm myself. Much like someone who is going to stop drinking or start eating healthy, I want to reaffirm my strategy and also hear feedback from the reddit investing community.

1) strategy: “buy the dip.” Or DCA. This is the common advice provided for investors on reddit but it is so much more easier said than done. It is so hard to watch one week old stock purchases or ETF purchases start to lose value at an alarming rate. The way to combat this is to remember; any money I throw in the market these coming weeks I will not need in the short term to pay bills or buy food.

2) market direction: NOBODY knows what direction we are headed. I’ll repeat: nobody. Yes, the reddit sub gangs are 100% sure we are headed toward a hunger games or mad max dystopia where you will have to sell your pubic hair as coronavirus mask materials. While that is intriguing, and entirely possible, I’m not growing my pubes out in anticipation. Guys we’ve either hit bottom, or we have not. THATS IT. Let me remind you, fear and uncertainty drive markets down, NOT NECESSARILY BAD NEWS. If you don’t think billion dollar hedge funds aren’t factoring economic risk for the next 5 years and beyond, you are foolish. Another way of saying this is with a popular reddit phrase, “it’s all priced in bro.”

3) my investments: I’m super conservative, I would be happy with a 5% long term gain on my money over a year or three if necessary, I’m not a r/wallstreetbets guy and will never be. That being said, I like ETFs. I believe ETFs have their downsides like anything else, but what I believe their largest vulnerability was “how will ETFs react to a super volatile market?” Turns out, they functioned alright. Another downside is your locked into what the ETF firm has decided to include, you can’t jump ship on one or two of the bad investments within the ETF. On the upside, I am comfortable buying riskier investments such as oil through an ETF because I can probably avoid getting totally screwed due to bankruptcy, mismanagement or trade war.

Anyway, hope this helps someone. I am not an experienced investor who knows all, please, let’s discuss!"

We all have a general feeling of how fucked things can get with coronavirus so I’m not too interested in that portion.

I’m more interested in how coronavirus will effect corporate debt.

Now normally I’d just say fuck it and invest in an inverse high yield ETF or go short on an ETF with enough option liquidity, and call it a day.

However, this still doesn’t feel like I’m getting close enough to the issue.

Since we can identify companies that are on Moody/S&amp;P/Fitch watchlist for BBB downgrades... now we’re talking. From there you can check out 10K for debt covenants and quarterly financials to see who is bigly fucked. Like Ford for example.

I know you can create an account on Moody’s, etc. and check out their ratings/downgrades as they happen, but do you know of any other resources that can easily identify downgrade potential, as well as sector the company is in?

Sifting through Moody’s shitty web interface makes me think there has to be something easier or more sophisticated.

2020-03-28,istavnit,75,Market decline is just getting started,"As massive as 2T sounds, the loans to struggling companies is not a great news for shareholders. While their equity is less likely now to go to 0, the chances of getting any payback for share ownership are now much further removed. Loans to companies prevent any share buy-back and dividends until 1 year after repayment of government loans.

The money borrowed now are like a shield between shareholders and any benefit of share ownership.

Obviously as long as they are taking the debt on they are removing that payoff to shareholder further into the future. Imagine that businesses will recover (to some extent) and start repaying the debt in a year, maybe finish paying it off in 5-10 years? Never? 

In addition to having to deal with debt repayment, borrower companies will be restricted in bonus payments and salaries. This could hurt them competitively against new entrants where applicable (nobody is starting another boeing or another airline). This could spur a new business where we will see new nimble companies come to market, but only some familiar tickers will be from today.

Even Facebook and Google are projecting decline of 20% plus in earnings, and they are ""indirectly-hit"". There will be massive revision in earnings for now as well as 9 months from now.

All this makes equities so much less attractive with questionable payoff. I say this market is worth less than 1/2 of what it was before (could be even less)"

Essentially, expressing the difference between price and value.

&#x200B;

Question here is how can a novice tell what stock is valuable. Stocks like AMD, Microsoft, Intel dropped by half or close to that. I think these companies have a good enough foundation that they will recover and continue  growing. Is investing in them a bad idea? Am I just better off investing 100% into index funds like S&P 500 (like VOO for example), which might net me less in the short-term but would get me enough later in life?

2020-03-28,wit221,16,Where do press releases appear first?,"I'd like to know the rough timeline of the first 60 seconds of a press release.

I have done some initial research and, until now, I believed that news items would first appear on the news agency's website. Then, the first ones to pick up the news (within 1-2 seconds) would be the players that have direct agreements with the news agencies, such as Bloomberg Terminal (whenever a news item is disseminated, the agency would send the item to Bloomberg). This would be followed by any scraping bots that noticed the news item on the website (within 30 seconds) and individual observers (within 5 minutes, albeit they would probably have been alerted by an automated system that got the news before). 

However, I have been noticing that those items sometimes appear on the news agency's website up to 30 seconds after the news item's creation timestamp and the underlying security's price had already begun to move accordingly. I do not understand how that is possible, however, since that would imply that news are disseminated to select entities before being made public, violating SEC rules.

--


ABSTRACT: n this paper, we compare the historical performance of dollar-cost averaging (DCA) with lump-sum investing (LSI) across three markets: the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. On average, we find that an LSI approach has outperformed a DCA approach approximately two-thirds of the time, even when results are adjusted for the higher volatility of a stock/bond portfolio versus cash investments. This finding is consistent with the fact that the returns of stocks and bonds exceeded that of cash over our study period in each of these markets.

Should I consider buying that or invest in Equity market considering the valuations are beaten down already and there is a good chance that I can make 12% - 15% compounded if I hold till 2030?

Edit1: For anyone wondering this is for an Indian state owned bank. The yield coupon was 9.9% at the time of listing in 2011. Dividend is yearly and has been paying dividend regularly. It is trading now at 9.5% yield at current price.

Edit 2: 9.5% bond yield translates to 6.6% after tax for me (I am in 30% Tax bracket). But with equity fund assuming I get 12% return over 10 years it will translate to roughly 10% after tax returns as equity tax is lower."

This is partly due to infrastructure factors as well as maintaining the country's ability to compete globally. Imagine if all US airlines went out of business, that would damage and impair America's image/soft power all over the world. Its shitty that these corporations get away with pissing away all their cash, but America cannot allow them to die out.

So what happens? Well, as these corporations become more and more dependent on the federal government to continue operating they will end up becoming an extension of the government. This is a lot like China's current system. 

On one hand, its this very unity that has allowed China to grow rapidly and maintain its iron clad power over its people and neighbors, but this very same system hinders progress and inhibits innovation. Company failures are fixed by brrrr'ing more money, stifling the natural free market. New technology will find it hard to grab a foothold when incumbent businesses are literally forbidden from dying out.

2020-03-29,MackMizzo,2,Leveraged ETFs for younger investors. (follow up from earlier discussion),"So 2 months ago this post/study were mentioned:

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/enr9xg/yale_economists_argue_that_the_most_financially/

Which basically stated that, despite the negativity surrounding the concept of investing in leveraged ETFs long-term, they were still a better buy ROI wise over an extended period of time. Well, here we are in the middle of a crash, and what better time to re-examine the possibility of going with an aggressive investing approach at time where funds are going to be dirt cheap.

So there are a few major, more obvious risks associated with these funds. If you take a 3x leveraged fund and its underlying has a -33% day, you're totally cleaned out. Done. This happened with $XIV back in 2018, a fund people thought was a free money train for years. Accordingly, I've decided to restrict my options to 2x funds as I'm not willing to entertain that possibility.

There is also the oft-cited assertion that their high expense ratios and daily rebalancing eat into their gains and your ROI when compared to the base fund, but in any tool that I've used to compare the growth of a hypothetical $10,000 over a period of 10 and 20 years it has well outdone the non-leveraged fund. For example, even at the bottom of the bear market during the GFC, $SSO was still up over $SPY had you invested the same amount in both 15 years prior.

So that leaves me to believe that the only serious criticism of a 2x leveraged fund would be the risk in that you could find yourself with your pants down during a time where you needed your money?

Welcoming any and all discussion about this again as I think this is a potentially great buy for the many younger investors on this sub. We aren't retiring anytime soon and can afford to take an aggressive approach in our 20's and 30's, and what better time than the bottom of a recession."

in depth discussion: [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-10-18/how-private-sector-balance-sheets-changed-recessions-podcast](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/audio/2019-10-18/how-private-sector-balance-sheets-changed-recessions-podcast)

The U.S. business cycles that ended in the last three recessions involved progressively greater and more troubling risk-taking behavior. Each ended with worse financial fallout and a longer period of recession and weak recovery. Much has been written about the bubbles leading up to the commercial real estate deflation in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the crash of the tech stocks and the ensuing bear market of 2000-2002, and the deflation of home real estate and the debacle in mortgage-backed derivatives in 2006 through 2011. Yet analyses of the bubbles’ causes invariably omit a critical point.

*The evolution of the economy’s aggregate financial structure has, over decades, altered the playing field for financial decision makers throughout the economy, increasingly skewing their available options toward higher risks, lower returns, or both.*

This paper presents two facts that help explain economic and financial performance in recent decades and offers insights into the current business cycle, the 2020s, and beyond.

1. Private sector balance sheets grew faster than income over many decades; thus, aggregate debt grew faster than aggregate income, and aggregate assets grew faster than aggregate income.
2. This disproportionate balance sheet expansion changed financial parameters in the economy, mathematically making financial activity increasingly hazardous and compelling riskier behavior.

The first of these statements is an empirical observation, easily documented. The second is the result of direct logical deduction. Together, they have several consequences:

* From the mid-1980s on—*the era of the Big Balance Sheet Economy*—financial decision makers have had to choose between progressively lower returns and higher risk.
* Too much private sector debt relative to income has adverse consequences, of course, but so does an excessive total value of private sector assets relative to income. An extreme value of aggregate assets relative to income means meager yields and operating returns on assets, distorted financial decisions, and an economy vulnerable to asset price deflation.
* Each successive business cycle in the Big Balance Sheet Economy era has started with proportionately larger balance sheets and has involved more reckless balance sheet expansion leading to even bigger balance sheets and a worse financial crisis.
* Each successive crisis, with more bloated balance sheets to stabilize, was more difficult to resolve and therefore required the government to engineer dramatic new lows in interest rates, heavy fiscal stimulus, and other measures to stabilize economic conditions. The measures eventually overcame recession and chronic weakness, but in doing so they necessarily caused further expansion of balance sheets relative to income.
* During the 2000s, either the housing bubble or some other set of highly speculative, excessively risky, and destabilizing activities was virtually inevitable.
* Increasingly unsound risk taking has been occurring again in the 2010s.
* The present cycle is almost certain to end badly. Although there are signs that balance sheet ratios are undergoing an extended, secular topping process, they remain extreme and will produce serious financial instability during the next recession.
* There is no nice, neat solution to the Big Balance Sheet Economy dilemma, no blueprint for a politically acceptable resolution. The task of preserving prosperity while shrinking assets-to-income and debt-to-income ratios is, if not outright paradoxical, at least plagued by conflicting forces.
* Government policy cannot prevent serious consequences when the Big Balance Sheet Economy corrects, but it can moderate them and help households, businesses, and the financial system cope with them. However, these tasks would be difficult, politically tricky, and prone to cause some backtracking on balance sheet correction even if policymakers fully understood the economic problem.
* Although the outlook is fraught with uncertainties, individuals and organizations can benefit by taking steps to prepare for, endure, and in some cases capitalize on some of the developments ahead.

The U.S. economy continues to face a bubble-or-nothing outlook. Participants in the economy and markets will keep increasing their financial risk until the expansion breaks down, and the bigger the balance sheets are relative to income, the more severe the breakdown is likely to be."

2020-03-28,chinawcswing,13,Why have Value ETFs been terrible in both the recent bear market as well as the current downturn?,"*Title error: recent bull market as well as the current downturn

For 5 years I have split half my investments into a growth ETF and a value ETF, covering stocks on the S&P 500.

During the bear market, the growth ETF was something like 2x to 3x better than the value ETF.

I was considering selling the value ETF, but read online that it would be better protected during a recession. However, after the recent downturn, my growth fund is in total up by around 13%, while my value fund is down by about 15%.

So not only did the value fund totally under preform during the bull market, even in a bear market it is so bad that I would have done better holding cash this entire time.

Are there any articles that discuss the possible reasons for why value funds have done so poorly in both the recent bull and bear markets?"

2020-03-28,razorfengraul,14,Long term outlook in a new world...,"Long time lurker, still new to investing so be gentle. 

There seems to be 3 different outlooks on this thing:

-Politicians: We will be opened back up by Easter (lol) or just sooner rather than later in general. 

-Health professionals: We're looking at raw data on a day by day basis and don't offer any guaranteed outcomes. 

-Investors (not all): We're skeptical and haven't seen the worst of it yet.

Regardless of any projected outcomes or hopeful jargon,  it's clear this isn't going away overnight. Business are going to be forced to shift their models in order to make ends meet. Small business especially will have to adapt or die. A stimulus won't keep startups and already troubled business open, at least this one won't, as we're still in the first half of this thing and not showing any signs of slowing down just yet. 

Even before all this I've been closely watching the self-service options that companies are increasingly offering and can't help but think now that the ""do it yourself"" attitude will no doubt increase across the globe. I work in member services at a credit union and have seen a large spike in self service options these past couple weeks. The amount of credit card debt being racked up right now on Amazon alone is quite astonishing. Of course that's normal, you'll say. But what a lot of you don't hear is the genuine concern and fear in people's voices. Of course a large base of our members are 55+ and the boomer doomer has every right to strike fear in them. But regardless, people aren't exactly rearing up to go back outside and touch stuff yet as certain politicians are implying. As people get more comfortable and used to leaving the middle-man out of their transactions over the next few months/year/who knows, I can't help but feel more business models will adapt accordingly. 

So I ask you, oh wise investors of reddit: Whatya think?
Do you see the rise in ""stay-at-home"" models being a long term thing when all this calms down? Do you, yourselves, feel the urge to get out in public and face people at normal distances to hand them your money? I agree it's still too soon to tell despite what I've seen and heard each day as it progresses, but you can't help but wonder which businesses and companies might benefit the most or take the most advantage of the situation and come out of this the strongest."

2020-03-28,prolikejesus,1,Confusion about how markets go up and down,"So does the markets rise and fall according to how much stocks are being bought and sold? Do options and future trades make any impact on the actual market? I know its a shitpost, thanks for your help though."
2020-03-27,georgejetsonn,270,Fed and the Treasury are pretty much the same entity with the new bill,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-cure-risks-being-worse-110052347.html

TL:DR - Fed can only buy or lend against securities that have government guarantee. 

Since a lot of the new helicopter money is aimed at securities that are NOT gov guaranteed, the Fed instead gives that money to the government (the Treasury) to do the purchasing themselves. The new Fed chairman is, by extension, Donald Trump."

2020-03-28,Jmurcia213,1,#SAVE= Invest,"Spirit Airlines stock plunged more than any other airline stock during the massive selloff driven by the growing COVID-19 pandemic.

However, Spirit Airlines has a very high cash balance relative to its expenses and plenty of liquidity to make it through the current crisis.

Low fuel prices and high non-ticket revenue will enable Spirit to break even or earn a profit with extremely low fares once demand starts to return.

Larger rivals that are more reliant on business travel will probably experience a slower profit recovery.

Spirit Airlines stock is a high-risk, high-reward speculative buy.

2020-03-28,Rosinaxoxo,0,Should I get a degree before trying to pursue a career in broking?,"A few years ago when I was 17, I applied for a junior wine broker role in a small firm in London. I told them from the start that I had only managed to achieve Ds and Es in my GCSEs as I had to leave school early due to severe health issues, although I was predicted As & A*s. 

The gentleman who interviewed me, reassured me that this didn’t matter as he had no GCSEs himself and is now running a small brokerage firm. He said they don’t mind, and even asked me to come back for a second interview. But a few days later he emailed me to tell me that i lacked confidence (which I can agree with) and I was too quiet, but maybe next time. Understandable. 

He had given me a glimpse of hope that I really could pursue a career in broking. But soon after, I got a full time job in a care home. Feeling too run down and exhausted to even contemplate the ideas I forgot all about my short lived dream. 

I’m not happy in this job and never will be. I enjoy the work and helping people, but the pay is awful and I’m just not satisfied. I want something that is mentally stimulating and I would love to be learning about, researching and analysing the markets whilst also being surrounded by money driven people. 

I apologise for the story, I just feel a bit foolish asking such a question, so I wanted to give a bit of background. I am happy to re do my GCSEs and do whatever it takes to get what I want and be successful. My questions are, what degree would be best? Was my experience when I applied for that job just a stroke of luck or could I look for opportunities similar and this time push myself to do better? 

Again, I’m sorry if I sound like a bit of an idiot. Everyone I talk about this to has just brushed me off but I want it bad and will do whatever it takes to get to where I want to be."
2020-03-29,EXLR8_Reddit,0,"Well, perhaps market manipulation sprinkled with a tech revolution?","A fair amount of what was prospected in my post last week pretty much hit directly on the head (Not trying to say I'm a trading savant or anything like that at all hahaha)... But to run it back, Gold hit practically exactly as I had called last week (putting it back within its base LT up-trending channel, Bulish vibes); Monday brought low futures & weak hands across the board early on which prompted people to turn to commodities... Both the S&P 500 & DJI dropped to test lows that haven't been seen since prior to trumps stepping into office; that was until major investors stepped in, stimulus hype kicked in & ya know, the printer got fired up XD....  I've been securing small of profits along the way with swinging scalps but ultimately am looking to have had great long positioning with most of my portfolio, at least until the dust seems to settle more (perhaps the second week of April or slightly later after the stimulus check had been received/ the economy is able to proceed amidst the chaos of the virus); having done fair bits of extensive digging following where Friday's close left us at, it's insanely peculiar across the board to say the least....

Before getting to analysis & projections, I first need to lay out new findings. There's been posts / articles floating around detailing specific bills put in place following 'The great recession' in 2008; articles which claim, following this great financial crisis in 2008 our gov't had taken steps which effectively merged both the federal reserve and treasury into one entity, which \*allegedly\* is under the supervision of the executive branch (more specifically, the president / whatever his or her team sees best fit for the current situation.) Moreover, the federal reserve is able to exchange securities within the stock market in order to recoup these 'debts' in a similar way that it would with bonds or other collateralize securities traditionally. {See details regarding the federal reserve & trading equities to recoup debts as detailed in 2005 [here](https://www.frbsf.org/education/publications/doctor-econ/2005/november/monetary-policy-stocks-sale-purchase/).}

One last thing I must lay forth before going into analysis; the previous link is the best I can find which might 'validate' the updated bills, and an update was added to the base of that web-page following the 2008 crisis which states, "" On November 25, 2008, in the height of the financial crisis the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin purchasing up to $100 billion in agency debt and up to $500 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities. Since that time it has announced several other large-scale asset purchase programs."" Following that line of text with a link which claimed to be 'access to their balance sheets' or 'the evolution of the FED's security holdings... and that link has since been deactivated. (WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A LINK THAT WAS POSTED ON A LEGITIMATE ORGANIZATIONAL WEBSITE) So yes, I am accepting the information presented on these bills/laws as true; and before continuing to read this post you will need to 'accept the above terms and conditions' lmao (Seriously tho, feel free to further contest them or try and validate the claims as you please, I have done a fair bit of research but haven't found anything concrete that contests the claims laid before us in the circulating articles.)

So what do these provisions mean? By accepting the above claims, it would basically mean that our gov't has the power to be actively playing 'the big short' in the stock exchange, targeting various failing sectors (taking the positions from large scale investing firms or openly in the market). More specifically sectors which have been lagging behind economically / they do not see fit to push our economic growth in the LT future... (The ability to pump up a market & make it look appealing enough for common investors to act amidst a slew of market uncertainty/upcoming catalysts) Mind you this is ALSO while having open access to infinite market manipulation at virtually no cost , and realistically are yielding FAR more profit on these these initial debts they're inuring currently. The bills/provisions would have theoretically made it quite literally impossible for any average trader to ever capture the 'full move' (as our fellow in 'the big short' was able to) on failing/financially jeopardized sectors ever again; effectively allowing them to throttle economic transformation, all while the FED is now milking maximum profits out of investors of dying industries before these investors even have a chance to understand that they are invested into a failing industry / company.

Now to begin analysis, in this mass hysteria I have seen a few varying correlations following the real world catalysts which have been in part driving the markets sentiments; correlations which have been getting glossed over here and there, but most posts highlighting them have had their factors barely or overly attributed to the crash in this event. Correlations have been between: speculative currencies (think crypto/ gold - see gold's live chart [here](https://gyazo.com/ad3d69694dd54ec9d0e76f258895c200)) and their ability to gain more strength than the US dollar in the future (relating to an underlying market-sentiment & desire to return to its bullish ways as the value of the US dollar appears to be in jeopardy), the current state of oils price relative to the warmest winter recorded in 20 years and how it impacts our energy sectors in the market, overall playing into the markets sentiment), and the state of the NASDAQ following Friday's close (An underlying desire for bullishness in the markets, specifically in companies which are already extremely prosperous and arguably not only be practically unimpaired by CV but will only continue to grow more profitable in the near & LT future of the economy; with a need to begin weeding out the weaker companies in our economy which can be found in the Dow Jones or even still in the S&P 500.) So if you can imagine, each of these three correlations have had major catalysts within the last month which impacted where they stand from a long term perspective and have upcoming catalysts which influence the speed of which they recover and how they do. Essentially I see this playing out as a market recovery that's never been seen before and realistically never could've been seen coming in such a way; ultimately leaving the majority of investors burned & nearly all scratching their head for a period of time to come.

Oil is currently at a key tipping point, it's bouncing off of its $20 support and OPEC has a deadline of drawing a resolution by April 1st (It has been reported that US officials have recently been in contact with Russian officials with the desire to reach a conclusion with OPEC & non-OPEC members, reassuring Russia that american companies will also comply with the reduction in oil supply & proposing that other non-OPEC members should do the same.) The drawing of a conclusion is just the catalyst oil is in need off to send it running back up closer to where it was once valued/ a fair price point.. This fuels my belief that oil is truthfully dying out in our countries energy sector (If you look at energy companies listed on the NASDAQ, they're renewable companies, not oil drillers/refineries) and ultimately those which are investing into oil for a long term position will inevitably just be giving their money to the gov't unless they plan to simply swing the catalysts at play currently. {See oils long term chart - [here](https://gyazo.com/81647bd368e7ea096c1521a10f9e1058)}. Notice that oil had almost totally crashed out before the 'Tech bubble' occurrence. I speculate that oil had become most profitable/ most sought after in the late 1900's before new age tech became more and more relevant, there were literally people & companies researching Fuel Cell technology for cars & renewable sources like mainstreaming solar panels; that is, until company heads started dying & I'm sure the gov't/world leaders came together looking for a conclusion, ultimately finding an equilibrium in supply & demand whilst no other competitors were able to threaten them & it seemed everything was playing in their favor, and as a result we can see oil price totally moon leading up to the 2008 recession... This peak is the true foundation for our long term downtrend, renewable energy sources began to rise in relevance and the general population has been so supportive of it that there has been simply been no other choice but to milk the oil industry as much as humanly possible similarly to how someone would play a biotech approval (OPEC meetings, trump pushing to send american oil production to the moon in order to 'make our economy more profitable.' However, it appears to me as a massive pump & dump to trap LT-dividend investors within, slowly draining their net-worth & the income they're receiving in the form of dividends from these companies (Now, a company like Exxon has a WAYS to go before any of the small drilling companies, but on the fundamental principle of oil price slowly draining out over the years, so would these oil/gasoline suppliers/companies - see Exxon LT chart - [here](https://gyazo.com/b375043db48e0144f3cf0b49d9dd4912).) Exxonn set a new high in 2014 and has never been able to recontest this, it's been trapped within a downtrend ever since then, not only that but about the time that oil had completely gone to the moon in the midst of the recession it appears that someone might've opened a short position on Exxon at $117, which is has NEVER touched since then; the closest was in 2014 when it touched $105 / share (the true start of its long term downtrend). Also notable on the chart, despite 'growing revenues' since 2016 exxon/other oil based energy providers haven't been able to create any kind of a LT uptrend which holds solidly in YEARS. This is factor number one in the week ahead imo, when we get news about this/ if a conclusion is able to be drawn by OPEC will be critical within the markets recoveries... CV is literally only playing within the bears favor on really weak handed investors / scalpers at this point; the markets are throwing hella bullish signals & i promise you that the Algos will not be ignoring them in this week to come, which will only act as another elevating factor for the markets in this war to ultimately kill off what seems to be mainstream Bearish vibes from trading communities/ day traders.

To discuss the NASDAQ - of all the major indexes, the NASDAQ is the only one which doesn't appear to lay in totally bearish territory {[Chart here](https://gyazo.com/5a9eea562ae1992801e50d2c541e7ceb)}. This is what interests me the most, the NASDAQ has bounced off of its up-trending channel that was set in 2016 (the SAME channel which was FINALLY able to break the long term resistance from the Tech Bubble fallout & create a bullish new high along with the rest of the markets at the time - reference the purple line in the image.) Now, the grey line & green trend lines are representative of the 'limitations' and the 'support' of our economies growth following the great recession in 2008... this massive fallout happened just as the NASDAQ had touched this line of resistance, and I believe this recovery will act as a spring board momentum which could send the NASDAQ onto another level. Why do I think this? Because the NASDAQ is comprised of the companies which LITERALLY define the future as we all know it... Heavily loaded Social media companies & innovative tech companies; then only gives way to the top travel agencies (the modern economy has been driven by 'experience' buying more than ever before,) renewable energy companies/prospects, household 'brands' (think pepsi,) banks, the nations top health care companies (yes, some of which will be leading the charge against CV - GILD, Abbott.)

What am I trying to say? I believe we are watching the foundation or further development of the transfer of wealth from many LT investors/401K owners into our government's pocket, all while the economy is undergoing a 'silent revolution.' Now this could take years to fully play out, and I believe this is why many economists will continue to look at this event and just scratch their head on what the significance was or why exactly our stock market had a never before seen recovery (Possibly it will be attributed to the common scapegoat at the moment - ""the FED is just printing money until the problems seem to resolve themselves."") Perhaps more catch on or the event plays out in an extreme fashion as more and more investors seem to read between the lines here & flock to the 'companies of the future' as they continue to increase revenues & outshine their outdated counter parts.)

""But EXLR8, what about the overhead concerns pertaining to the current condition of the USD value, its strength in an economy, and how it relates to the overall buying power of the consumer?"" Well, to that I would say this concern is barking up the wrong tree, especially with the conditions which are put before us in the articles detailing the fed's 'improvements' in investing strategies.. These strategies totally dismiss any desire for our gov't to back our dollar (per say, adopting the gold standard, or switching to a crypto-currency - view crypto's current 'trend' [here](https://gyazo.com/dfc18132e0c4a67eef22c4eeaac68db0)) because then it would limit their ability to 'adapt' to the severity of the 'situation' presented. Especially while considering how they are handling this process, they aren't printing money which will forever stay in circulation, this money will be put back 'into the reserve with interest' once big investors decide they want to return to their positions; also, if im not mistaken this would even allow for them milk MUCH more money than they've injected into the dying markets by recouping it on short positions. (To clarify, am I bullish on Gold or Crypto? Yes, but they aren't entirely related to the primary factors currently at play, at best these factors just opened the opportunity for a great buy in time on crypto/gold.)

How does this effect our investing strategy moving forward? Well personally, I'm going to be focusing companies which I see playing a MASSIVE roll in our society's future / will be able to 'keep up with the times.' At least until this situation plays out more, and I'll certainly be on the lookout for anything the market seems to throw at us which appears to disprove this theory. However, currently I haven't found anything which compels me in another direction or to just leave it and say ""ahhh corona-virus is the fall of the US/world economy, I can't invest right now.""

Pieces of further analysis: Current state of the SPY (S&P 500) - [here](https://gyazo.com/bdd2e4e6ee506c2e05ba10b6cffa0488). Key takeaways - Fridays close left us above the long term uptrend established in 2016, which was the trend that pushed our markets into higher highs. The selloff seen this month was quite literally the most dramatic EVER seen, worse than the height of the 2008 sell off, and FAR worse than at any point during 'the tech bubble.' I view key support as \~247, and while the bears have been screaming about the looming 'death cross' I don't think algo's or investors will give a damn about that one indicator, especially given the hype that will be generated following the clearing of OPEC's deal this week... (I believe the closing of the OPEC deal will give the oil sector enough of a relief to ignite buying within various other sectors/companies that appear equiped to overcome the quarantine period / appear as tho they can come out on top of their industry/niche.) Example 2 of a dying sector - [VIAC](https://gyazo.com/a31664d0ad2e2d8aebe12767c8d1f66f). VIAC had been a major company which many investors thought 'could never fail.' However, look at the LT downtrend it has been stuck in since 2014; which directly correlates to the rise of streaming platforms (NFLX) which was a power house even before the 2008 crash, and surfaced as the 'heavy weight champion' of mediums which people watch television (not to mention much more profitable than traditional TV/Movie networks - NFLX charges a premium to use their service AND profits from promotion / adds put on their platform, andddd not to mention they're literally sourcing their own material at this point, cutting back on production costs that typical TV stations would incur.) Example of dying sector 3 - [PEI](https://gyazo.com/40f9293dd4006979f8648e83de9306d3). PEI is a real-estate investment trust which specializes in the leasing/development/etc of shopping malls... Again, has been stuck in a long time downtrend (Like most Real-estate investing trusts that aren't specializing in residential renting.) since shopping malls have been becoming practically obsolete in the recent years, especially with the rise of Amazon & other similar companies.

This week: Suspecting a slow bleed monday/tuesday, or at least until the OPEC deal is struck.. Gold & crypto will see early movement as the DXY continues to drop; and upon release of the opec news it will ignite a frenzy of buying across the oil sectors. Effectively pulling the indexes up enough off of their supports enough to promote buying amidst various other sectors (which have beautiful intra-day technicals right now), essentially creating a chain reaction throughout the markets as plenty of whales have been sitting on the sidelines, starring at discounted tickers, wondering if this is the dip.

LT: My projections would lead me to believe this will be a market recovery never seen before; not one of a traditional recession, not one of a depression, and not entirely a 'V' shape.. following this next round 'relief' the bears will be eager to secure some kinda of gains, and those sectors which are truthfully dying will be seeing some of the most dramatic jumps in pricing which will end up pulling index pricing into strange directions... not anything crazy dramatic, but talking the NASDAQ-100 up 1% while the SPY & DJI continue to lag behind  by -.5% loses; essentially laying the groundwork for the potential of a 'reverse tech bubble.' Perhaps in the weeks to come we see another slew of frenzy sell offs in various sectors based around insane indexes, creating one last major dip before another bullish recovery as the prospering sectors help ignite buying from 'LT investors / Firms' in the dying sectors, overall pulling the indexes up in another dramatic fashion.  Perhaps it is time to say, welcome to the future."

2020-03-27,MasterCookSwag,78,Bill Ackman turned 27 Million in to 2.6 Billion.... Or did he? Kinda.,"Link to the letter to investors: https://assets.pershingsquareholdings.com/2020/03/26222617/Pershing-Square-Capital-Management-L.P.-Releases-Letter-to-Investors-March-26-2020.pdf


Shamelessly stolen from Levine's column today: 

>That $27 million is not the total cost of protection; it is the running cost of protection. Here’s his explanation:

>>In February, the Pershing Square funds purchased credit default swaps (CDS) on various investment grade and high yield credit default swap indices, namely the CDX IG, CDX HY, and ITRX EUR. At the time of purchase, the IG or investment grade indices were trading near all-time tight levels of about 50 basis points per annum. The high yield index, the CDX HY, was also trading near its lowest spread ever. When one adjusts for the fact that a number of companies in the high yield index were on the brink of default (and these near-default companies’ spreads were in the thousands of basis points), the spreads on the rest of the companies in the index were actually well below the 2006-2007 all-time
lows. …

>>This is best understood by a somewhat simplified example: assume you purchase $1 billion notional of CDS on the IG index for 50 basis points. In summary terms, you are committing to pay 50 bps times $1 billion, or $5 million of premium per annum for five years. Assuming you sell the CDS a month after purchase at a spread of 150 basis points, you would receive approximately the present value of the spread, in this case 100 basis points per annum, times the $1 billion notional amount of the contract for the remaining 4 years and 11 months of the contract’s life.

>>The present value of 100 bps for 4 years and 11 months is a number which is slightly less than the present value factor times 4.92 years times 100 basis points times $1 billion, or approximately $45 million. Since the contract in this example was only outstanding for one month, the total premium paid would be 1/12th of the annual payment of $5 million or approximately $417,000. Therefore, for a total outlay of $417,000, you would make $45 million. This understates your actual risk, however, because if spreads were to narrow during that month, you would lose substantially more than the premium. That said, if you were confident that spreads would either stay the same over the next month or widen, you would only be risking the premium of $417,000.

>Oversimplifying somewhat, Ackman didn’t agree to pay $27 million for a huge hedge; he agreed to pay $27 million per month for five years for the hedge.[1] In the event, it moved so dramatically in his favor so quickly that he was able to terminate at a huge profit in less than a month. If it had taken another month, presumably he’d have kept the bet on and paid another $27 million and the trade would still look amazing, though not quite as amazing (50x return). If in fact we had moved into a new golden age of corporate credit, and spreads had tightened, he might have had to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to terminate the trade.[2] I take his point that, when he entered the trade, spreads were at all-time tights and that risk seemed low, so it was asymmetrically attractive, but, you know, those were the market rates; lots of people lost a lot of money over the last decade betting that rates couldn’t get any lower. In any case, though, the $27 million and $2.6 billion are sort of apples-to-oranges amounts; Ackman got into the trade with a small cash payment and a larger mark-to-market risk, though he got out of it with a much larger mark-to-market gain.

I found that pretty interesting.  It's still a phenomenal trade but less ""I bought this one lotto ticket and made bank"" and more ""I bought an insurance policy for crashes that I would pay premiums for over the next five years and my house got destroyed the next month"""
2020-03-28,dial0663,6,Life Insurance Companies,"This is a somewhat morbid question but its an industry I think about regularly. Life insurance companies for the most part pay most of the claims, because people die. Life insurance companies are different than car insurance companies because everyone isn't going to get into a car accident and going to need a payment. Therefore for the most part, life insurance companies are similar to pensions where they hold cash to make investments for future outgoing cashflows.

I am familiar with how insurance companies play a role in the PE buyout market and the fixed income market. Now that people are dying and more people may die in the future from COVID-19 how may that affect the market."

So I keep seeing post popping up asking ""hi stock X is now down 30,40,50,60 percent should I buy it??"" and that stock was already was down 30,40,50,60 percent over the last 5 years. the answer is no, don't. There's a reason they are spiraling downwards, in most cases its because its a turd of a company. can they turn around? sure, but in most cases its very unlikely. don't try to strike gold by polishing turds and hoping to find a giant gold nugget when theres plenty of non-turd , shiny gold nuggets laying around right in front of your eyes. My personal advice, pick those up, buy the companies that were performing exceptionally well before the market crash and you will be way more likely to succeed. Its better to have a high quality companies with a 15% discount, than a turd 90% off."

2020-03-27,PutCallParrot,53,Options Basics: Log Returns and Volatility as a Function of Time,"**Before you read:** This is part of an ongoing series on the basics of options trading and valuation, focusing on stock options. This is the fourth post in the series. You do not necessarily need to read the preceding posts for this one to make sense, but please conder reading them first if you are not familiar with the following:

* The concept of equity. This is covered in part one: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options\_basics\_what\_is\_equity\_and\_why\_should\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fdx8tw/options_basics_what_is_equity_and_why_should_i/)
* The concept of puts and calls as options on underlying assets, and how an increase in the volatility of the underlying asset can increase the value of options. You should also know, on some level, what the following stand for as they relate to options valuation: S, K, and σ. All of these topics are covered in part two, which also introduces a highly simplified version of the binomial model: [https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fggids/options\_basics\_intro\_to\_puts\_calls\_and\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fggids/options_basics_intro_to_puts_calls_and_the/)
* The time value of money and incorporating this concept into the binomial model, along with the concept of discount rates, including the riskless rate “rf:” :[https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fjmkj8/options\_basics\_introduction\_to\_time\_and\_discount/](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fjmkj8/options_basics_introduction_to_time_and_discount/)

This post will introduce the idea of log returns and show how to convert them to and from arithmetic returns (the sort of returns you are probably used to calculating). It will also show how to convert σ for one time period into σ for another time period.

Mastering these concepts makes option valuation far easier. This is more of a math post than a conceptual post. The conceptual posts are probably more fun, but math is what allows us to apply the concepts to actual options when we trade, so readers can expect a post like this once in a while.

**Math Knowledge I Assume You Have:**

* Basic arithmetic and fractions
* Exponents and what happens if an exponent is a fraction or is negative
* The concept of a logarithm (you don’t need to be good at them, just a vague idea that they are the inverse function of an exponent and that they have bases)

If you don’t know all of that, a couple hours on your favorite tutorial site will do the trick, or at least get you to the point where you can follow along.

**Important Terms for This Post** (for quick reference if you get a bit lost):

Continuous compounding: compounding (as in compounding interest) continuously. This is a theoretical concept.

e: e = about 2.71828. e is a very special number used in continuous compounding. Those of you who know a bit of calculus may be familiar with e. 

ln or “natural log:” A logarithm to the base of e.

**Continuous Compounding and e**

Consider a loan with an interest rate of 100% per year (I’m talking about APR for those of you who know about APR versus EAR). If the interest compounded once per year, then at the end of the year, the balance would be 100% higher than it was at the start of the year. If it compounded every six months, it would be a little higher than that, and here’s why: At the end of 6 months, 50% of the 100% would have accrued, so the balance at the end of six months would be 1.50 times the original balance. Then 6 more months would go by, and the 1.50 would become 2.25 (1.5 \* 1.5 or 1.5\^2). By the same logic, if the interest compounded every quarter, it would be a little higher than that (1.25\^4 = 2.44), and so on. 

Mathematically, if you were to call the number of times you compounded “n,” then you could say that the balance at the end of the year with a 100% interest rate is going to be (1+1/n)\^n. 

The upshot here is that even without changing the interest rate itself, compounding interest more frequently results in a higher debt balance at the end of the year. However, there is a limit to this effect. If you were to try the above equation with several different values of n, you would eventually notice that as n increases, the difference between the end of year balance using n and n-1 becomes smaller. In other words, the marginal impact of increasing n by one decreases as n increases. Put yet another way, the difference between n=2 and n=3 is far greater than the difference between n=200 and n=201. 

Eventually, if n is high enough, the marginal impact of increasing n by 1 is negligible because you are essentially compounding constantly. If you run some calculus, to find that value of n and find the balance at the end of the year, the balance you will get is about 2.71828. That number is very special in mathematics. We call it “e.”

A logarithm in base e is called a “natural log” or “ln”. The natural log of e is exactly 1 (ln(e) = 1). 

**Returns**

If you have an investment that grows from $A to $B over a period of time, **B/A-1 is the arithmetic return** over that period of time. You may be used to calculating arithmetic returns. If you aren’t feel free to DM me.

**ln(B/A) is called the log return.** For example, if your $1 appreciates into $2 over a year, your yearly return would be 100%, and your log return would be about 69%. The log return is smaller because **the log return represents the continuously compounded rate necessary to achieve a given amount of appreciation.**

I suggest using Excel for working with these kinds of calculations for learning purposes. The formula for natural log in excel is just =ln(). So for the above scenario, you’d write =ln(100%) to get 69%.

To convert a log return back to an arithmetic return, just raise e to the power of the log return and then subtract 1. Using the example above; (e\^69%)-1= about 100%. In Excel, the function to raise e to a power is =exp(), so you would write =exp(69%)-1 to get about 100%. 

All of this may seem a bit technical, but **dealing with continuously compounding interest rates is far easier** **than dealing with normal interest rates**. Let’s prove it by trying a problem two ways; first without converting to continuous rates and then by converting them.

You may recall from the last post that we had a practice problem that asked us to value an option that expired in 90 days. To do so, we needed to manipulate the rf in a complicated way because the rf we were given compounded annually. If you don’t remember what rf is, please take a quick look at the last post. 

Let’s say rf = 2% compounded annually. To get to a quarterly rate without using log returns, we would have to do something like this:

(1 + quarterly rf)\^4 = 1+rf

(1 + quarterly rf)\^4 = 1.02

1+ quarterly rf = 1.02\^(¼)

1 + quarterly rf = 1.00496 (use excel or a calculator to get the exact number)

Quarterly rf = 0.496%

To check our math, (1.00496\^4)-1 = 2%

Of course, we would need to do it all over if we wanted a different compounding period.

You’ll notice that quarterly rf was roughly annual rf / 4, but not quite. In options valuation, and really investment in general, you’ll need to convert rates to various time periods all the time.  While using an approximation just once may not make a huge difference, the little inaccuracies add up, so if you want to figure out rates without converting to log return, you really will have to go through that whole complicated process. 

Now let’s try it the easy way using log returns. You’ll see you can just divide the log return by 4, raise e to that power, and subtract 1.

On paper e\^(ln(1.02/4)-1 = 0.0496%

It’s that easy. In Excel, it’s just as easy:

exp(ln(1.02)/4)-1 = .0.496%)

Those of you who have tried a few trades may notice that options can expire in any period of time. Imagine how hard it would be to calculate a discount rate for something expiring 5 days out assuming 252 trading days in a year without using log returns! It would be easy to do with log returns: exp(ln((1+r)/(252/5))-1. 

Let’s say you owned a stock and you wanted to examine the historical annual rate of return using the last year of daily returns. Without using log returns, you would need to perform a complicated function where you manually multiply some imaginary balance by each day’s return +1, and then back into a result at the end of the year. If you had the log returns, you could just add them all together. That’s right, **the log return over any given period of time = the sum of all log returns during that period of time.** They don’t even need to be the same time period. For example, 12 hourly log returns + 1 daily log return is your log return for a day and a half. 

This property of log returns makes it ideal for valuing options over an awkward period of time, and you can calculate σ for any time period using log returns as well. For example, if you wanted daily σ, you can just use the standard deviation of daily log returns. If you use log returns for your discount rate and rf, you'll be fine to use log returns for σ as well.

Let’s say you wanted to convert σ from one time period to another without using returns data. In options valuation, you’ll need to do this often because it’s the only way to convert the time period for IV. Because σ is the square root of a variance, it’s a bit more complicated than just adding and subtracting, but not by much. Let’s say you had σ for a long period of time called σ(long) and you wanted to find σ for a short period of time called σ(short): σ(short) = σ(long) / the square root of long/short. For example, to get the daily σ using the yearly σ, assuming 252 trading days in a year; daily σ = yearly σ/sqrt(252). 

As a side note: be careful when you look up IV on a platform and make sure it is compatible with your units for modeling purposes, especially if you aren’t using Bloomberg, and particularly if you are using data from certain discount brokerages. For best results, if you are looking for mispricings, back into an IV using your model given the price, then see what the price is for whatever IV you think is most appropriate. If the prices don’t match up, consider the bid ask spread, and decide if you think there’s a trade. If you set everything up in excel or some other program beforehand, you should be able to make this process quick and easy. Using an API should make it even easier. **Don’t just trust somebody else’s data if you’re going to put money on it; use it as a sanity check and independently confirm.** 

Now let’s put it all together and easily value a call option we previously could not have valued without a ton of work. 

S=300, K=301, σ = 40% per year. rf=0.7%. Today and tomorrow are both trading days, and the option expires tomorrow. Assume continuous compounding and 252 trading days in a year. Assume, as we have before, that the price changes just once.

Let’s start with rf for 1 day:

0.7% / 252 = .0028%. That’s deminimus in my opinion. We’ll plug it in anyways, but this is one of those times you could probably use 0% and skip the discounting process. 

Now we’ll work with σ:

40%/sqrt(252) = 2.52%

300\*1.0252 = 307.56

307.56 - 301 = 6.56, so the option is worth 6.56 in the up state.

The option is already OTM, so it is worthless in the down state. 

50%\*6.56 + 50% \* 0 = $3.28 so FV is $3.28

3.28/(1+.0028%)= PV = 3.28 (the change was less than a penny)

So our call option is worth **$3.28**. Because we used log returns, valuing an option expiring tomorrow wasn’t really much harder than valuing an option expiring in a year or in any other amount of time. Remember that difficult put option problem from the last post? Log returns make life easier. 

**What’s Next?**

For the next post, we’ll start valuing options using more nodes in the binomial model, which will complete our basic overview of the binomial model. Then we’ll have a little fun with our complete model and look at certain kinds of hedging, put call parity (username relevant), and perhaps some other useful concepts. Then, at last, we will tackle the Black Scholes model. After that, I plan on talking about a few trading concepts that use all of these models to the trader’s advantage and tackling any nagging questions people have. 

If you enjoy these posts, the best thing you can do for me is to spread the word and tell people to follow me on Reddit. If you want more content, please message me or look me up on Patreon. 

**Challenge Problem: I’ll give gold to the first correct response as usual.** 

Part a) Let’s say we have a put option expiring 4 (trading) days from now. There are 252 trading days in a year. rf is negligible over this 4 day period. S = $100. K = $100. The call option is priced at $4. What is IV for a full year? Round to the nearest %.

Part b) Let’s say you buy the option. Given no other changes, annual IV immediately increases by 10% (so that if original IV was 34%, new IV would be 44%). After this occurs, you immediately sell the option. How much of a profit did you make? Round to the nearest penny."

2020-03-28,thegooddoctorben,6,The market in a slightly larger view,"I don't know what the market is going to do. Neither do you. But there are things that we can be more or less confident about. The combination of those things, plus your investment time horizon and appetite for risk, should allow you to make smart long-term decisions.  Here's my take on what we do and do not know. 

**High confidence:** 

* **We will develop a vaccine within 1-2 years**. This is an enormously disruptive but ultimately short-term hit to the economy, assuming we manage the business/economic dislocations smartly. 
* **The federal government will continue to prop up businesses and individuals**. The utterly deadlocked Senate and Executive Branch, riven by truly ugly partisan politics over the past three years (a President literally impeached and acquitted), came together in record time to deliver major pieces of legislation to address some of the economic dislocations. And the political leaders on both sides have said that what's happened so far only takes us to the middle innings at most. We are highly likely to continue to get major federal action. 
* **The course of infections and burden on our health care systems can be managed**. We literally know our future. We can look at other developed countries that responded to this outbreak and observe our current news tracking their past trends. In Italy and elsewhere, social distancing is working, even if it was implemented too late. Infectious disease experts know and have predicted the course of this virus, and are saying we haven't hit the peak yet; but can flatten the curve with the right measures. Many people will suffer, but the vast majority will be okay (physically). 

**Low confidence:**

* **How many businesses and individuals will be economically devastated**. While the government will act to preserve the system, it cannot dictate outcomes. Many companies will go bankrupt, many people have already lost their jobs, many others will follow. How many is difficult to tell right now, as it depends on a variety of interacting factors, including the effectiveness of our health care response and the types and levels of continuing government support. 
* **How low the stock market will go**. The stock market had the most severe and sudden crash in a century. However, it hasn't declined as much as even an average bear market - and this seems to be more than your average economic calamity. It's reasonable to expect it to go lower; but it could just be in for a period of volatility without any clear direction. A full recovery in the next month or two seems very unlikely absent a proven vaccine, which is also very unlikely simply because of the amount of time it takes to test even developed medications. 

From the above, *at this point* I think it's fair to say the severity of the economic catastrophe is not fully known, primarily because we don't have a solid end-date of when relatively normal economic functioning can resume. However, we can have fairly high confidence that we will eventually recover and be on decent economic ground when we do. That suggests that if you are comfortable with riding/handling volatility in the short term, you can and should have started to invest some in the decline so far, and can continue to do so. Those that are more risk-averse should be more cautious, investing less of any cash on hand until a clearer picture emerges. You may lose some gains, but may also prevent yourself from making dumb decisions. 

Good luck all, whatever your goals, and whatever you're facing in life."

I don't fully understand the text as I'm not a lawyer and there's lots of references to other statutes that are hard to follow.

So it sounds to me like the government will provide a loan and then forgive 50% of payroll costs, up to a cap($10 million, or sum certain costs, whichever is lower), if the employer retains employees on payroll.

How is eligibility determined? Is this only for employees that are told not to work and stay home, but kept on payroll? The only text I can find is this:

>Certification.—An eligible recipient receiving loan forgiveness under this section shall make a good faith certification that the uncertainty of current economic conditions justifies the loan request to support the ongoing operations of the borrower, and acknowledges that funds will be used to retain workers and maintain payroll.

For example, could a shale oil company apply, with the argument that declining prices due to a decline in demand due to COVID-19 affects their bottom line, qualify, even though they stay open and workers continue to report to work?

I don't see text explicitly requiring that employers keep workers home. Am I missing something or is the government literally covering up to 50% of payroll for small-mid size companies that don't fire their workers?

How big of small businesses qualify? I feel like I'm missing something, or this would make me very bullish on small caps."

* The value of a commodity is based on demand and supply
* The S&P500 is the most well-known index fund in the world, and many people (including myself) bought it blindly without much thought as a passive investment strategy
* Given that there's a much greater demand for stocks which are part of the S&P500, while the amount of stocks is not infinite (supply is limited), it stands to reason that stocks in the S&P500 might be priced higher than stocks which are not in the index (because demand is greater due to the association with the index). This assumes that there are no other market forces which increase supply correspondingly.
* If stocks in the index are inherently priced higher for no other reason than that they are part of the index, it concludes that you would get a better price if you bought stocks which are not in the largest index funds.

Is the above logic correct? Or are there market forces which correspondingly increase supply whenever there is increased demand? Given that passive investors will buy the index no matter what its price is, it seems unlikely that there is a constant increase of supply (people selling the index) to account for the increase of demand (passive investors) -- the sellers would eventually run out of stock to sell, and the buyers never stop buying."

Lawmakers  also added a separate provision that would make it easier for banks to  temporarily modify loans without downgrading them to troubled status, a  step meant to give flexibility for borrowers under pressure in this  pandemic.

Federal Reserve officials are reviewing new ways to support financing for state and local governments, many of which are on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic and will face huge borrowing needs as revenues plunge, according to people familiar with the matter.

The economic-rescue legislation Congress approved this week asks the Fed to charge headlong into areas it has long considered taboo—supporting lending to businesses, cities and states. The Fed traditionally avoided intervening directly in credit and fiscal policy, preferring to leave such matters to Congress and the White House.

That is changing now because of the fast-moving economic crisis—and because Congress has essentially directed the Fed to get more involved by providing $454 billion to the Treasury to cover any losses in new Fed lending programs.

The Fed has dramatically expanded its balance sheet over the past two weeks, by nearly $942 billion to $5.25 trillion as of Wednesday. The central bank has lent freely to help firms avoid a wave of defaults that could turn a recession into something much worse.

What the Federal Reserve Can Do to Fight Recession

Over two weeks, the Fed has unveiled six lending facilities, five of them enjoying a total of $50 billion in support from the Treasury. Those programs have freed up cash for major Wall Street institutions and will backstop money-market funds and markets for commercial debt.

Democratic lawmakers have made support for city and state borrowing a priority in recent legislative talks, and the latest bill directs the Treasury secretary to seek a Fed lending program for municipal finance.

State and local governments are confronting skyrocketing borrowing costs even as they are straining to pay expenses associated with the spread of the virus. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told Fed Chairman Jerome Powell last week “to think big and help our states,” she said in an interview on PBS this week. “They are taking a big bite of this wormy apple and they need much more in terms of resources.”

Under its governing law, the Fed can’t directly buy corporate debt, and it is limited to purchasing municipal debt of six months or less. But it can work around these restrictions by creating lending facilities that lend or purchase debt, subject to approval of the Treasury secretary.

The Fed has already dipped a toe into muni-debt markets by expanding a money-market lending backstop to include certain types of municipal debt—and by purchasing some highly-rated municipal debt in a facility backing the market for very short-term commercial debt.

As of Wednesday, short-term interest costs on variable-rate municipal bonds have more than tripled compared with two weeks ago and are now higher than the rates governments typically pay on 30-year bonds, according to an index maintained by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.

Monday’s announcement by the Fed to include more municipal debt in existing lending facilities appears to have made only a small dent, bringing the index, which tracks bonds that adjust their rates weekly according to what investors are willing to pay, to 4.7% down from 5.2% last Wednesday.

Interest rates on other short-term muni debt that spiked last week have fallen after the Fed said Monday it would purchase some municipal variable rate debt. Rates on water, power and sewer bonds issued by New York City and Los Angeles fell back to their typical rates of between 1% and 2% Thursday after hitting nearly 8% on Friday.

Kent Hiteshew, who established an office of state and local finance at the Treasury Department in the Obama administration, has been hired by the Fed to advise on muni markets, according to people familiar with the matter.

Among the questions Fed officials are considering: Whether to expand existing facilities to accommodate other municipal debt or to launch a new facility devoted to state and local finance. Fed officials will have to decide which municipal debt might be eligible for support and on what terms.

There are limits to how far the Fed can lend using its emergency authorities. Its loans must be well secured, which the Fed typically satisfies by restricting borrowing to highly-rated issuers.

“The states and localities that need the most help are the most risky by definition,” said Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at Evercore ISI, an investment research firm, who previously worked in the Treasury Department during the Obama administration.

The Fed and Treasury brainstormed ways to support hard-hit state and local treasuries after the 2008 financial crisis, but opted against doing so.

Governments have been cancelling almost all planned long-term muni deals, borrowing they typically rely on for infrastructure needs and budget management, after investors fled muni mutual funds last week and prices plummeted. There was $761.7 million in total muni issuance last week, according to Refinitiv, compared to around $8 billion during a typical week earlier in the year.

Government borrowers include states facing high Medicaid costs, delayed income tax collections and huge drop-offs in sales taxes as commerce has slowed to a standstill—and municipalities that run hospital systems, nursing homes, jails and public-health departments.

""As our borrowing costs go up, that’s fewer dollars they have to allocate to the crisis,” said Matthew Chase, executive director of the National Association of Counties.

Fed officials have long had broader philosophical objections to intervening in financial affairs of subnational entities. The central bank is the fiscal agent of the federal government, and they have viewed state and local finance as the domain of Congress and the Treasury Department.

“The Fed’s response has typically been, ‘Look, if the federal government wants to support state and local finance, they can do that directly,” said Lewis Alexander, who served as an economic adviser at the Treasury Department from 2009-11 and is now chief U.S. economist at Nomura Securities.

“There is a real reluctance to blur the line between the federal government and the state and locals. You start going down that road, it’s hard to know where to stop.”"

20% rally on news of giant stimulus package almost certain to pass.

Sp500 is now up to 2600, down just 20% from all time highs.

Meanwhile, what's the forward outlook? Many businesses will continue to stay shut down for months. Loans will prevent some bankruptcies, but will have a severe negative impact on future earnings as they must be paid back.

Stimulus checks and boosted unemployment will drive increase consumer activity, but for non-essential industries that are shut down, they won't see any of that money.

What other positive news comes after this? Congress likely won't take further action for a few weeks. Cases will continue to explode. States and municipalities will start resorting to more strict and drastic measures, as well as other countries. Then of course, there's the slim possibility that as things get much worse, Trump flips(he does often) and decides on a national shutdown, which could kill markets.

I'm guessing the market hits the circuit breaker on Monday after a weekend of bad looking news.

Personally, I predict market will bottom out again at 2200 in a couple weeks. When things start looking really grim, I'll buy back in."

It describes how Ronin Capital was unable to meet capital requirements because of losses they took on VIX positions. I thought clearing firms just cleared trades between two counterparties. Can they also hold positions in their own accounts as well? Or are they simply taking offsetting positions with all of their clients as described [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/clearingcorporation.asp)?

2020-03-26,Thqsca,462,The one billion dollar question - are we in a classic bull trap?,"Hi all,

The markets are on track for a third straight green day with Dow currently at +4% at the time of this writing, and having that crazy rally 3 days ago with 13%\~ increase.

Historical unemployment rates that are worse than the great depression and no solution in sight for the virus (especially in the US with the president not taking action with a full lockdown) means that there are many more deaths to come. The tourism, entertainment and sports industries (among full others) are completely crushed. And we still didn't get to the supply chains issues (Iphone 12 has been postponed by a few months already, total smartphones shipments have decreased YoY in the most amount ever, etc).. What makes America a powerhouse - consumerism - is on hold. So why are the stocks going up? Is this truly phase 2 of a bull trap or magically the US decided that printing money and offering 2 trillion dollars will solve everything and they were actually right?

Maybe I'm stupid, maybe I waited too much on the sidelines but when you hear that even the Olympics got postponed which *only happened previously twice at war times*, it's almost 'obvious' that the market will at least crash more than 2008, at least.

So, thoughts? Yeah, I know that this might be the daily what if thread but also I'm truly confused. Would love your thoughts on this wild market right now."
2020-03-26,_WhatchaDoin_,3553,My experience of the 2008 bailout,"I wanted to share my experience of the 2008 bailouts because we are among friends. Right? And friends help each others, and share their experiences. Right?


During the financial crisis of 2008, it became clear that the government had to step in. People were losing their jobs, stock market dropped by more than 30%, the market was going up and down by 5-10% a day (the amount my brokerage accounts would go up or down was more than what I was earning in a month at work). It was humbling.


It was really tough and difficult to trade. Buy on the down days? Sell on the up days? Hold it until sky clears, despite having bled a lot of money already? I was over leveraged too (through LEAP options), which was not the smartest thing to do at the time, but heh, are you going to lock the loss?


Then came the bailout, with a lot of volatility leading to it. A lot of back and forth for days for politicians to get a chance to pass it. (They may have failed to pass the first version even, I don't remember).


Finally, one of the branch passes it, and it's time for the other branch to pass it. ""About time, after the bailout, things are going to get better, we can save those companies, we can move ahead and blue sky is coming.""


I remember at the time, I was looking at the final votes, and I could not believe it. As the votes would come in, and it became clear that the bailout would pass, S&P futures started to drop, like a stone. WTF!!! Help is coming, everything will get better, why is it dropping?


Well, the reason is simple, by signing the bailout, politicians agreed that we were in a shitty situation, companies needed to be saved, and the lousy bailout was getting signed, and there was no more good news down the line for a while. We shot our ammos, and now let's pray. So it became sell the news.


As the market continued dropping days after days, and I was going to be wiped out, I had to sell to not be over leveraged anymore. I had to take a 6 figures loss. And I am fortunate that I sold, because the market continued to significantly tank for almost 6 more months to level I did not think we would reach. After selling, I was not taking as much risk anymore, I got burned hard.


After we reached the bottom, I switched my positions to risky assets, and I was able to make up some of the losses. But that was a great learning experience, and I figured that I preferred to learn that lesson at the time, when my accounts were not too big than later. Recovering from a 6 figures loss is doable, but more than that, and it is a decade or more of setback.


Well, I can say that almost 12 years later (fuck, already!), the situation is very similar.
This time, I was ready, and maybe that will be another post to explain what I did in 2019-2020, as it can be easily applied.


So today:

- People were losing their jobs. Check.

- Stock market dropped by more than 30%. Check.

- The market was going up and down by 5-10% a day. Check.

- Bailout in the process, taking days to agree on. Check.


I am not saying that the market is going to drop after the bailout is voted, but watch out for that.
Unlike 2008, there is no blue sky coming. The bailout is only a short term fix. How long do you think $1200 per person is going to last?


Unlike 2008, we know that the worst is ahead of us. We still don't know. In the US, the coronavirus pandemic is expected to peak in at least 2-3 weeks. But who knows?
As we are doubling every 2-3 days, it could mean 100 times more new cases per day. 100 times more death per day (few weeks later the infection). It's absolutely a staggering and awful number.
Hopefully, lockdown will be enforced in every state, so we can reduce this grow rate.
Hospitals are already over capacity, nobody can tell exactly how this is going to end (except that's going to be a carnage).
Esp. as some are talking about removing the lockdown in 2 weeks!
And even after the peak, it means that people are still getting sick, people are still dying, as they are hospitalized for 2-4 weeks.
Expect at least 1-2 months of pain, even after peak.


I understand that the market is forward looking, but there are still many opportunities for false head starts, and failed bounces from the bottom.


From my experience with the 2008 bailout, nobody could really predict the bottom. Even as it was a financial crisis.
This time, it is not looking pretty, so please don't be like the 2008-me, don't be over-leveraged (yet), things can go either way. Politicians are very good at messing up a crisis.


And most of all, be safe and healthy, stay home as much as you can. It is going to be a rough ride, and unfortunately we are only getting started.
My sincere thoughts for people with friends and families that are going through hardship, sickness and death.
Hang in there!

Edit: Thank you for the feedback, comments and kind words. Much appreciated. Stay safe!"

We might get some sort of irrational 10% jump when people think they have a cure ready by the end of the year, followed by a 8% drop because of earnings. We might even have a 20% gain followed by another 30% crash.

Since you have to still pay income tax on it wether its now or when your retired and take it out (ie: 70), why wouldn't you use this opportunity to take it out of the 401(k) and into a regular investment account, effectively just making you more liquid and unchaining you from the bounds of a 401(k)?

What am I missing, what other negatives are there? Since this is a low income year for me, isnt this the perfect time to pay the eventual income tax now, and put it in a brokerage?

From what I understand, the only difference is paying income tax now vs later ( dependent on your tax bracket of course, but for this exercise, lets say you are in the same tax bracket )....

2020-03-28,Potstick3rs,0,What the Actual Fuck is a Stock?,"I currently work in equity research for an asset management firm so I have had a good amount of experience researching companies, reading through sell-side reports, GAAP/Non-GAAP financials, press releases etc. But I keep banging my head wondering, what the actual fuck am I betting on with stocks?

For example, is its earnings growth? Is it revenue growth? An earnings beat? Best case scenario, it is free-cash-flow to equity which would technically be the cashflow that equity investors would be entitled to. But that's not the case at all. In fact, if a company goes bankrupt, most of the time, the only people who get paid out are the bondholders - sometimes portions on the dollar (#PG&E). So what are we even betting on? 

All these philosophies like value investing, growth stocks, GARP, etc, etc. which try to take a certain angle on stocks. All that seems to be really happening is that you're noticing an inflection point in what you believe matters to other people (could be earnings, could be cashflow, could be revenue growth, could be managerial). And how you make money is that you see this inflection point, or growth story before the majority of others do (volume). Thereby securing yourself a low entry price point and over time, people will come to realize that the company meets those metrics and they'll put money on it. But who cares if revenue grows if it literally never pays you back? Sure there are dividends. But companies don't pay high enough in dividends to warrant the kind of speculation and premiums we pay on stocks. When's the last time someone saw a DDM or cashflow DCF in a sell-side report or market consensus estimate?

Another thing is that you could be right, but no-one cares. For example, you believe FCFE will become healthier for the company in the next 5 years as they pay down debt and optimize their supply chain. 3 years in, and cashflow is healthier than ever (everything else equal/improving), allowing the firm to spend more money on capital expenditures, invest in projects and generate greater returns/gain an edge over competitors... But the stock price lags the market. Because no-one else is looking at those metrics, nobody cares. I've seen this countless times where a company could be doing well on all standards on which it was judged previously but then all of a sudden, the stock no longer reacts to that kind of information. People shift from caring about earnings to revenue to the balance sheet (during a recession) etc.

In contrast, when looking at bonds, that type of investment vehicle makes perfect sense. Company A needs $1000. Person B has $1000 so they loan their money to Company A. However because there's a certain risk involved, the risk being they might not get their money back, they charge an interest rate, along with expecting initial principal payment at maturity. That makes perfect sense. And I can see what one would be looking for when buying bonds. Buying stocks is way less clear to me. 

The bottom line is, stocks to me feel more like a game of predicting where will people buy next, and then can you put your money there before they do. They feel more speculative than ever. The OG stock the Dutch East India company made sense and indirectly created the world's first stock but since then things just have felt pure speculative.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

NOTE: Please absolutely feel free to critique me, call me out, say I'm retarded. I am really confused and I am hoping someone has an answer to this, much like the bond example. It just feels like sometimes I have no idea what the fuck I'm betting on. Yea I can forecast to a pretty good degree (in bull markets) whether or not the company growing their revenues at x rate is plausible, or whether or not competitor X will gain share and how that will affect them. But as long as someone isn't willing to buy a stock, it will never go up, no matter how ""good"" it might be."

Seems fun so I'm gonna continue being active here I guess. (I posted on both [r/stock](https://www.reddit.com/r/stock/) and [r/investing](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/) because they seems the same to me - they should just merge)

Anyway, I got some questions about VIX, the volatility index and how to make money from volatility. So listen, you can Google around and ask professional traders - you will learn that trading the VIX is virtually suicidal. If you made money a couple of times from trading VIX ETP (exchange traded products) like VIXY, SVXY, UVXY and all..don't feel too good. I once made bank from XIV (inverse volatility ETF) and then poof, it went to zero (google ""XIV blow up""). Lucky for me, I locked in half of the gain. But still... you know. ***Bottom line: avoid playing with VIX ETPs - but hey, we are all a little bit of a gambler right - so good luck brothers.***

If you are not a gambler, I thought I would share some alternatives on how to profit on /hedge from volatility of the stock market.

\-/-

**1) Invest in market makers: $VIRT, $MKTX, $FLOW (traded on Euronext), $MKTX**

Google a bit about market makers. You'll find that these are the people that creates liquidity in the market. The bid/ask spread on your screen on every stocks you see, that exists partly because there are market makers. They make profit by exploiting the ""**bid -ask spread""**. Now, when volatility is high, the bid-ask spread gets wider, and the trading volume gets highers (more transaction are happening) therefore , market makers will make more money. Think of the bid-ask spread as their fees/commissions for enabling your buy/sell orders to be filled in. Currently I'm long $VIRT. As you can see [here](https://ibb.co/3drbWrc), when volatility in the market is higher, VIRT stock price gets higher too.

If you want to be more quantitative, you could compute the correlation of VIRT to VIX, and also its beta against the market (which is negative). The good thing about VIRT is that it doesn't swing wildly, and it is a company (not an ETF/ETN tracking an index).

Its indicator for transportation of dry bulk internationally as well as general shipping market bellwether . So it is indicator for how big is demand for shipping capacity versus the supply of dry bulk carriers .  The demand for shipping varies with the amount of cargo that is being traded or moved in various markets . That index is indicator for slow economy . 

As you can see  [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/BDIY:IND) , we peaked on that index in September of 2019 and since than its mostly drop . And it is significant drop , from 2,518 to current 582 . That is almost 80% . Huge for something like this . Its not BTC or penny stock .. Last 10 days its going down every day ( yesterday 3.48% ) . And Dow is keep going up . With current corona situation, countries all around the world closing borders , small, medium and large business closing door, unemployment sky rocketing , and 12 years of bull market someone can really think this drop is over ? Those are people same as our president , who doesn't want to see big picture and only care of what will be current look and it doesn't matter that trash is pilling up under the carpet . Wait until we got numbers on unemployment rates ( and im not talking about number coming out in few days im talking about numbers coming out in the next few months ) . Then percentage of people infected with corona virus in USA . People that dont want to go back to their job because they are scared . Numbers for first quarter earnings that coming out next month  , etc etc .. 

We will see much bigger drop and don't let this pump fool you .

2020-03-27,Jchen192,10,"Buy the rumors, sell the facts","This is my opinion, take it or leave it. Just wanted to see what everyone else is thinking about right now.

I'm sure at this point everyone have already heard the news about the feds trying to inject the economy with 2 trillion dollars. We honestly have no clue if this is going to happen since it's gotta pass at the house. Best case scenario, it passes and 90% of American families will get a check from uncle Sam for about $1200 or $2400 if you're married. But what's going happen from there?

The markets been doing amazing the pass week just based on this news alone and it didn't even happen yet.
Lets say the bill get pass Monday 3/30 and the IRS starts working on it the same day. Now idk about you, but it took at least 3 weeks for them to direct deposit my refunds this year and I did it early. Now imagine if they have to process over 100 million checks( about less than 1/3 of the us, using conservative numbers right now) at the same time. It's going to take longer than 3 weeks for people to get their checks and that is with direct deposit too. So the time is going to be even slower with people who received their refunds by mail. This puts us at a time frame of April 17 the earliest of receiving the check. This could be different for corporations and small business. 

Now lets be honest, even with access to this money, the majority of the people will not be able to spend it. The virus is going to get worst before it gets better. Especially if people can't follow simple rules to self quarantine. I currently live in New York and it seems like we are couple weeks ahead of the rest of the U.S in terms of how fast the virus had spread. It's only a matter of time before the rest of the country catches up the NY, Ca, or Wa. I hope I'm wrong, I really do. 

That is why I think that what we are seeing right now is just a short term rise in the market. People are excited that they're getting free money, but that doesn't change that fact that no one is going on a cruise anytime soon. planes aren't going to be magically filled with passenger anytime soon. Especially with it being a global pandemic, more boarders will close before restrictions are removed.  Unless the virus magically disappear by itself (which will take time) or a cure is found, it's going to take some time before people will go out spend money again. Even if there is no order to shelter in place, the fear of the virus will keep some people from going out. 

It's going to get worst before it gets better. Lmk what you guys think"
2020-03-27,catratus,8,"Investing in Online ""Businesses""","Does anyone have experience with this?  

Lmk if this is not the type of investing we talk about in this sub; I invest in equities and real estate like everyone here, but in recent years I've been looking at buying businesses - specifically, online ones.  

Here's a good aggregator of these types of businesses: [https://app.centurica.com/marketwatch](https://app.centurica.com/marketwatch)

* These typically trade at 2.5-3x multiples of annual profits - which are basically the same as offline, brick & mortar businesses if I'm judging by local comps (I'm in Southern California).  
* The monetization models are basically ad-driven, ecommerce, SAAS, affiliate, KDP (books), dropship, etc., but the whole pitch is that these are largely passive.  According to all the brokers out there (I won't name them for reasons you'll see below), these are enterprises where you only need to work 2-3 hours a week.  You hire a VA, you outsource, you manage, and live a sub-4 hr workweek.  
* Purchase prices are anywhere between $15k-$1m+.

So theoretically you get a 25-30% mostly passive return (inverse of above multiple).  Going into it, my whole thesis has been, why don't I assemble a portfolio of about $200k-300k in these, work 10 hours a week, and earn six figures on a passive basis.  If you go out there, you'll see all sorts of blog content & podcasts touting this lifestyle.  

So after doing a lot of due diligence, I invested in one and have since evaluated about 15-20 others - signing NDAs, putting down deposits, all to look through their financials.  

And with the experience of the business I bought (it's an ad-driven one), and looking through the financials of what seems like countless others, I'm leaning toward the idea now that these brokers are sca-, I mean, misleading.  

**I'm writing because I want some opposing opinions; I** ***want*** **to be wrong here.  But these are my big red flags I can't get answered by any broker or seller to the extent that I would commit another $100-200k to this strategy:** 

* First, I mean, if you're really earning 25-30% passively at 2-3 hours a week, why would you sell the business?  Especially in the $100k+ price range, where it means you're 'passively' earning at least $30-35k a year?  Where are you going to get that return otherwise?  All the sellers I've spoken to have the exact same answer: they have ""another project"" they want to get into.  But unless they're multimillion dollar projects, why don't you just 'passively' operate the businesses for a year or two and build up the cash to do it?
* Next, all the brokers, unless it's usually a $400k+ business and thus will have to qualify for an SBA loan in order to attract a wide buyer pool, will tell you they ""do not have"" access to real financials (expenses).  So you need to buy based on pro forma expenses.  Every business I've looked at will send you a simple sheet of absurdly low expenses - one $4/hr VA from the Philippines, $100/year hosting costs or whatever, but here's the thing about online businesses: *every single* consumer tech company we all know needs to spend a ton on marketing and awareness.  Every consumer 'internet' company is not profitable precisely b/c of marketing & consumer acquisition.    
But, when you look at the financials of most of these online 'businesses', expenses are like 10-20% of revenues, max.  Unless it's ecommerce, in which case there's COGS and almost nothing else.  How is it the case that these companies can get and hold on to their customers without spending ANY money on marketing and advertising?  The brokers and sellers will tell you: oh, we have great SEO, we're targeting an ultra niche long-tail keyword that no one else is targeting,...a laundry list.  This point is the one I can't get my head around the most.  If you check out their listings, you will see a ton of businesses launched in the 2017-2018 vintage and being sold (dumped?) now.  They will show a crazy exponential visitor growth curve.  And they will state that they spent nothing on marketing.  I mean, if you're really so good that you can drive millions of visitors to a run-of-the-mill baby clothes AMZN FBA business, or a romance novel KDP business, or scale an authority site on survival gear in a matter of 18 months by yourself with no paid marketing, shouldn't you go work at or build a real unicorn?  You'd get paid more instead of trying to cash out of a $200k website.  
* Which gets to my last point, which is that for a lot of these sites I'm quite skeptical that the number of hours you need to work, even after 'training', is anywhere less than 20 hours.  There is simply no moat on these businesses.  GOOG & YT algorithms are getting changed all the time, and AMZN competes with its own sellers.  The point is that to stay ahead of the constantly changing situations, and the fact that a kid in his underwear from Saigon or Chiang Mai can instantly start a website that does the exact same thing as you, using all the exact same tools, means that...how can you be 'passive'?  

By no means am I saying that you're not actually buying a real business.  But that's the point.  I think these 'business' sales are really all 'asset' sales.  You're buying a website.  You're not buying a 25-30% return b/c you don't even know what the expenses truly are.  You're buying yourself a job, just as you would with an offline business which trade at similar multiples to these 'online businesses'.  You get location independence, yes, i.e. you can run it from Koh Samui at any hour of the day, but you also don't really get any sort of advantage over an offline business in your town, which is more subject to space constraints & regulations & a *moat* than online stuff, because the platforms you built the businesses on are constantly changing, 0 barrier to entry, and low-cost competition is rampant.  The advantage of online seems negated.  

So my question is: if you're trying to be a micro-PE fund and 'invest' in these, how can you tell the real businesses from the fake ones?  Because the brokers are not incentivized to tell you and won't.  Should I just concentrate on businesses that will provide audited financials?  

And please tell me how I'm wrong and why..

Sorry it's so long.  

**TL;DR is:** 'online business' investing is a trend promising 25-30% largely passive returns.  I have strong reasons to believe these are nowhere near that level of return, nor passive, and not that enticing.  But tell me why I'm wrong because I want to retire."

So for example, I was listening to a Bloomberg podcast where the hosts were talking about Microsoft’s regulatory brouhaha in the 90’s and IBM’s rise in the 50’s. 

I knew about these Issues because I had stumbled on them via accident (either on reddit, at a class back in the day or on a podcast). 

Now I am wondering how many (business history) things I don’t know that are out there ??

Is there a book/journal/source with this type of info ?? 

For example with history, you can get a book that discusses the Roman Empire and all the wars/political drama that happened during its existence or during a specific time period.

2020-03-27,yoamloco,1,I think the most important part of the stock market is the human reaction.,"Maybe the reason why the stock market went up is because the people are confident that the economy will go back to normal before the whole coronavirus.

The usual ""This is the end of the world hide your wifes and children"" panic sell everything and hoard all the unnecessary amount of toilet paper for the next 5 generation of family. Also the president Trump as much as you guys dislike him is the key to why the market is going up.
* His speech about trying to contain the coronavirus by ordering the medical supplies to places that need them the most.
* the two trillion dollar bill that was going to be passed(which caused mood swings with the stock).
* The fact the food and household supplies are being resupplied to stores at break neck speeds.

I will predict that the market is going to have another ""mood swing"" when Easter comes up because that's when Donald Trump says that the economy will continue as it was before everything went downhill. The emotions of people is what causing the stock market to go up and down so erratically not the economy itself or coronavirus. As bad as what's going on with the world with the whole quarantine thing going on, it's not the end of the world guys. As long as we  have Costco food court and Elon musk memes, we will prevail.

# Fed Set to Launch Multitrillion Dollar Helicopter Credit Drop

Call it Helicopter Credit.

The Federal Reserve is poised to spray trillions of dollars into the U.S. economy once a massive [aid package](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/senate-passes-2-trillion-virus-rescue-plan-sends-bill-to-house)  to fight the coronavirus and its aftershocks is signed into law. These  actions are unprecedented, going beyond anything it did during the 2008  financial crisis in a sign of the extraordinary challenge facing the  nation.

“The Fed has effectively shifted from lender of last resort  for banks to a commercial banker of last resort for the broader  economy,” said JPMorgan Chase & Co. chief U.S. economist Michael  Feroli.

The coming rain of credit -- historic in both size and scope -- will be made possible by [$454 billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-25/fed-s-anti-virus-lending-firepower-could-reach-4-5-trillion)  set aside in the aid package for Treasury to backstop lending by the  Fed. That’s money the central bank can leverage to provide massive  amounts of financing to a broad swathe of U.S. borrowers.

“Effectively one dollar of loss absorption of backstop from Treasury is enough to support $10 worth of loans.” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in in a rare nationally-televised [interview](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/powell-says-fed-will-keep-credit-flowing-as-virus-hits-economy) early Thursday morning. “When it comes to this lending we’re not going to run out of ammunition.”

He told NBC’s “Today” show that the Fed was trying to create a bridge  over what may well be a substantial decline in the economy in the  second quarter, to a resumption of growth sometime in the latter half of  the year.

“It’s very hard to say precisely when that will be,” he said.  “It will really depend on the spread of the virus. The virus is going  to dictate the timetable here.”

While the Fed can help by keeping  interest rates low and ensuring the flow of credit, “the immediate  relief” for Americans will come from the Congressional aid package,  Powell said. The bill [includes](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-26/senate-passes-2-trillion-virus-rescue-plan-sends-bill-to-house) direct payments to lower- and middle-income Americans of $1,200 for each adult and $500 for each child.

Combined with an unlimited quantitative easing program, the  Fed’s souped-up lending facilities are set to push the central bank’s  balance sheet up sharply from an already record high $4.7 trillion, with some analyst saying it could peak at $9-to-$10 trillion.

### Beef Up

The bill passed the Senate late on Wednesday and is now being considered by the House.

The  first order of business for the Fed -- once it has been signed into law  by President Donald Trump -- will probably be to beef up some of the  emergency lending facilities it’s already rolled out, particularly the  ones for corporations which were limited by the amount of money that was  available from Treasury prior to the aid package.

The central back is then expected to establish its so-called Main Street Business Lending Program to provide help to smaller firms.

“Very quickly we hope to stand up a very broad based lending facility that could be leveraged up to $2 or $3 trillion,”  Senator Pat Toomey told reporters Wednesday. “We’re hoping it’s a  mechanism to keep businesses alive for a few weeks or months until our  economy can resume.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is also pushing Powell and the Fed  to do more for hard-pressed state governments on the front lines of the  fight against the virus.

### Bite the ‘Wormy Apple’

“I’m  telling him to think big and help our states because they are taking a  big bite of this wormy apple and they need much more in terms of  resources,” the California Democrat told the PBS NewsHour television  program on Wednesday.

In his “Today” show interview on Thursday, Powell said the  Fed was “already helping state and local governments” -- an apparent  reference to the inclusion of some municipal debt in the central bank’s  commercial paper and money market financing facilities.

It was the  late economist Milton Friedman who floated the idea of a helicopter  drop of money into an economy fighting a severe recession. Former Fed  Chairman Ben Bernanke later described that approach more prosaically as a  broad-based tax cut financed by the central bank.

This is  different. Rather than the Fed financing the federal government,  Congress is providing money to absorb any losses the central bank may  incur on its emergency loans -- some of which will be going to riskier  borrowers.

And unlike helicopter money, the ramped up lending is  aimed not at stimulating the economy but rather at preventing a credit  crunch that could make the recession worse.

“This is helicopter  credit,” said Wrightson ICAP chief economist Lou Crandall. “They’re  still in the fireman role rather than the stimulus role.”"
2020-03-27,street-guru,0,"$TSLA 2020 estimates now largely de-risked, but what now?","Street has been consistently cutting estimates to reflect the impact from COVID-19. Estimates for 2020 deliveries are now in the low-400k's, down by about 100k from pre-pandemic, and well below delivery guidance to ""comfortably exceed"" 500k. Expectations on margins and EPS have also come down substantially for 2020-2021. Seems like the numbers have been largely de-risked for 2020.

TSLA ended 2019 with $5.8bn in cash and subsequently raised $2.3bn in a secondary equity offering. Q1 likely burned through $1bn (seasonally tough quarter for cash flows), but it should still have >$7bn, so ample liquidity to weather this storm.

The bigger question now is how the right side of the ""V"" recovery will look. This will partly depend on whether the US government will step in to help the industry. While the street has priced in auto industry shut down of 1-2 full months, investors are now running scenarios of 6-9 month shutdowns. If such a scenario seems increasingly likely, then there's certainly going to be more downside for TSLA (and $GM, $F).

Fortunately, there is good reason to believe the US government won't let this scenario happen. The auto industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the US, generating more jobs than any other manufacturing sector, indirectly supporting 10-15m jobs in the country. The OEMs and suppliers account for 3% of US GDP.

While the topic of auto stimulus may be a couple of months early because there are obviously more pressing matters for lawmakers during the pandemic, we could start to see headlines on stimulus discussions by early summer. Looking back to the 2008/2009 crisis, there was support for consumers to buy cars (remember Cash for Clunkers?) and support for banks to help finance cars.

If the US government does step in to help the sector and stimulate the economy, this would be a great buying opportunity."

Does anyone have an understanding how what each of these programs are intending to do and what it might mean for equities? 

From what I understand these programs give the Fed ability to use securities as collateral for reserve requirements, it seems the Fed is now in the business of buying stock. To me how can the market actually be efficient if an entity can artificially manipulate the price of securities. Short selling, put buying etc aren't exactly *bad* they allow the market to sort out the businesses which may or may not exist and when they fail a repurposing of capital and resources can occur to make the sector itself more efficient, sort of like killing old cells in the body so healthy ones have more energy to survive. It seems like now the Fed has indefinite control over this process, further allowing companies to leverage up with unhealthy amounts of debt and take riskier bets. There almost so no incentive not to do that moving forward, and if the company goes bellyup they can either get 0% loans from the fed or just buy their shares outright from the primary dealer.

2020-03-27,georgejetsonn,6,Maybe a naive idea,"Here is my interpretation of the recent financial events:

Helicopter money from thin air will go to people and businesses. This is somewhat similar to WW2 gov spending that led to the so-called prosperity during war.

Except that this time the war happens on US soil, too, and more money won't stir up production and output, but merely keeping the economy on floating level while driving the value of the dollar down. 

The only way magic money can be an actual stimulus with a net positive output is if businesses participates in the effort against corona by building hospitals, equipment, ambulances, people get hired in the health system etc.
But this isn't happening, most will people be staying home and not having any activity.

This isn't a stimulus, it's an adrenaline shot to an economy that is lying on the ground faint.

What the gov and FED could do instead (or along with) printing money would be to issue a ""Corona bond"" to protect the economy from a bubbling inflation in the next period and giving everyone a chance to participate in the economic effort. Am I understading the situation correctly? Would this be a naive idea?"

2020-03-27,Manticorea,8,Would it be a good time to invest in REITs?,"With the majority of REITs taking a big hit this month, I believe some types of REITs will be good for long-term investment. Here is my argument. Please tell me what you think.

&#x200B;

1. Commercial REITs are still very risky due to businesses shutting down, and perhaps being unable to make payment. This may mean commercial REITs will have a worse earning season than other types.
2. Mortgage REITs are at less of a risk because of the FED's willingness to go essentially to minus interest in order to insure steady cashflow. I know it is harder for banks to earn profit when interest gets low due to decreasing interest spread, and I assume the same would apply to mREITs, but still the recent drop is more than enough to make up for the lower interest. On the flip side, I know rising interest rates is also a risk to REITS, but since we might be entering another period of long recession, I don't think we have to worry about a big hike in interest rate in the near future.
3. REITs in retirement sector will continue to do well due to boomers retiring.  REITs in renewable energy and other clean technology will continue to do well regardless of the drop in oil prices.
4. REITs in data storage sector will continue to do well, but has barely taken a hit. This means that with limited cash, investments in REITs in other sectors will yield higher returns at least in the short term.
5. One concern that I do have is if a particular REIT has high-yield bonds and other risky low-grade bonds that they will have to take a loss on if the pandemic gets worse. The FED will not be able to save all."

2020-03-26,thri54,17,"Crude contango, Oil tankers, Commodity traders, and you.","Some disclaimers before I start:  I’m not a financial analyst, I’m a student who’s been investing for maybe two years.   This post is long and there will be no TLDR.  If you do read this, I’d love some criticism.  I can’t poke many holes in this strategy, but if someone smarter than me can, feel free to.  

With that out of the way, Let’s talk about oil.  If you go look at [WTI futures today](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/crude%20oil%20-%20electronic), you’ll see something peculiar.  A barrel of WTI crude today sells for a hair under $24, and has dropped almost a dollar in today’s trading session (at the time I’m writing this).  A barrel of oil in August sells for $30.  Oil only a few months in the future is worth 25% more money.  This is called contango, when future contracts are worth more than present contracts.  In short, this is because nobody wants oil right now, and you can’t just shut off the pumps.  Saudi Arabia and the Coronavirus have, in tandem, skyrocketed current supply and destroyed current demand.  

So, how can one profit off of this?  To figure that out, we first need to learn how a company like Vitol can profit off this.  Vitol can buy May ~~contracts~~ physical crude at $24 and sell August contracts at $30.  Boom, 25% profit in three months, *risk free.*  All they have to do is store it; but how?  The answer is very large crude carriers (VLCCs).  Giant floating oil cans, usually used to transport oil over the open ocean.  Vitol can rent a VLCC from may to august, load it up with 2 MMbbl ($48 MM) of may WTI crude in the Gulf of Mexico, anchor it, then deliver on those $60 MM of august contracts in the same damn place.  

The only problem is every investment firm and their mother is going to be bidding for those VLCC contracts.  Risk free 25% returns in three months when interest rates are effectively 0% would be a free lunch, and there is no such thing.  I can’t speculate what the actual split would be, but If I could get even a risk free 3-4% return in three months I’d be over the fucking moon.  This means just about every cent of that $12 million dollar profit will become revenue for these tanker companies, which you can buy *right now.*  

Let’s switch gears and do some rough math on tanker companies.  [A 5 year old VLCC is currently worth about 75 million.]  (https://www.ssyonline.com/free-charts/5-year-old-secondhand-ship-values/#)  The average life expectancy of a VLCC is 20 years and Euronav amortizes their tankers at 5% of their upfront cost per year, so a 10 year old VLCC could be worth $50 MM, 15 year $25 MM etc.  With the oil contango as it sits now, A vlcc could expect 48 million in revenue over the next 12 months.  That’s ~$130,000 a day.  This means that the average 10 year old VLCC could expect to do 100% of its NAV in revenue over the next 12 months, and it’s pretty cheap to just park a ship at anchor. That’s a wicked return. [It was only ♫ the 26th night of September ♫ that VLCC TCEs were predicted to rise to $56,000 a day in 2020 by Argus](https://www.argusmedia.com/en/news/1985017-tanker-rates-to-rise-postimo-2020-panel)  But wait, there’s more!  Many of the tanker companies are trading *below NAV*.  $INSW is trading at .55 p/b.  $STNG is trading at .49 p/b.    And, if you want to really kick that risk/reward up a notch, $TNP is trading at .17 p/b.  If you want less risk/reward, companies like DHT, EURN, and FRO are trading at NAV right now.  Less leverage, more competent management, but less DWT (deadweight tonnage, i.e. tanker storage) per dollar of market cap.

Anyways, let's do some back of the napkin revenue calculations:  [DHT has 23 VLCCs in the spot market.](https://www.dhtankers.com/vessels/)  The company’s worth ~$1 B, and did $375 MM in revenue last year with a net income of $16 MM.  Let’s say, conservatively, they make $9MM/quarter-spot VLCC.  That’s $828 MM FY2020.  Given roughly the same operating expenses, that's a potential profit of $469 MM, or 2:1 EPS.  That’s 30x their FY2019 earnings.  This is assuming the oil contango doesn’t get any steeper, which it very well might as countries finish topping up their strategic reserves and the oil has nowhere to go.  [Even today, future oil prices are rising while spot oil is falling.](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/crude%20oil%20-%20electronic)

 And what happens when all our VLCCs are tied up in storage contracts and the world tries to end the quarantine and open up for business?  Transport rates *skyrocket.*  Not just the VLCCs, but the VLCCwomen and VLCChildren too.  I.E.  every suezmax, panamax, and afromax in the world's fleets will be worth their DWT in gold.  Oil demand and oil transportation are (roughly) equally inelastic.  It’s reasonable to expect charter rates to stay at the moon for at least 6 more quarters, and that could give tanker companies enough cashflow to buy back just about every floating share at current prices.  No pun intended.  But wait, there’s more!  If you haven’t been following, every oil and gas company under the sun has cut their capex.  What happens when no one’s drilling and no new wells are opening at the end of the world’s quarantine?  Oil prices soar and contango stays until new production can be guaranteed.  It takes years from order to delivery of an oil tanker, and years to ramp up oil production.  Hundreds of thousands a day for a VLCC could be the norm for years to come.  It looks like Tanker companies are on track to add a few zeros to their quarterly EPS for months if not years.

Alright, greedy speculation over.  I’m personally long $FRO, $EURN, $INSW, $DHT, and $STNG.  To restate, I’m not a financial analyst, I’m an engineering student with pretty limited investing experience.  If you can poke holes in my arguments, please do.  This seems too good to be true but I really can’t find the downsides that warrant some of these companies trading at half NAV.  

Here’s where I got the idea.  Kupperman knows a lot more than I do and can probably explain it better in his blog:

2020-03-26,coffee-trader,8,What the stimulus can actually do to the economy,"The stimulus is roughly the size of 5 weeks of GDP. The efficacy, however, is limited. A few reasons:

1. It doesn't restore investment and consumer confidence to pre virus levels. Most of it will be used to barely get by or as precautionary savings
2. It is not as timely an efficiently assigned as actual market activity (the real economy generating profits, rent and wages by the day)
3. The loans also aren't necessarily efficiently assigned or spent. They're handing money based on need but how it's used and received won't be as economically efficient as regular bugdet decision making. This risks the creation of financial bubbles and acquisition of junk credit
4. Crowding out: the stimulus will be financed with bonds. Those bonds need to be purchased at the expense of investing (probably not such a big deal in these times with low investment confidence though)
5. You can't legislative or QE the creation of actual wealth. Only real and demanded output is wealth. You can alleviate the need for liquidity thanks to our fiat money system, but it isn't actual wealth. In the best case, it's wealth borrowed from the future, and in the worst, it's just inflation (financial bubble)

The conclusion: it cushions the fall and probably avoids the long term destruction of value (some jobs and businesses), but ultimately you can't get something for nothing (back to point 5), otherwise the FED would always keep unlimited QE and government would pay for everything. In terms of markets, I expect more bull traps on the way to the bottom before the recovery, and perhaps a less horrible bottom."

2020-03-26,6pjEgRaabbf7HGQqCcy1,140,"If you already have a entry-exit goal for a stock, use a two-legged delayed bull spread for your long term positions instead of limit orders","You are cheating yourself by using limit orders. Especially during this volatile period when premiums are... well... at a premium

Let's use a blue chip. The sort of stock found in a stock-based 401k. We are going to invest in MSFT.      


----

*Leg 1: Buy stock*  
Purchase a stock you want to invest in.     

MSFT 146.92     

Normally, you would set a buy limit order (please don't use market orders) at 146 or similar.    

Instead of a limit order, I suggest writing a put.    

Determine how long you are willing to wait to get your microsoft share (assuming this is your retirement account and you will hold the stock for years, you can probably wait months for it). The date you are willing to wait will be your options expiration date.    

So instead you write a put on MSFT at $145 or $150. Lets do $150 expiring on 15 May 2020 (51 days out).     

In exchange for this put, you receive a premium of 12.00 per share.     

At some point, you will be assigned on the put since it is in-the-money. This represents a cool 8% return on your money in 59 days  (57% annualized) before you even own the stock.     

In the unlikely event that you are not assigned (and the option expires), you just write another option and take another sweet premium.   

The downside: 
You are ""locked in"" at the strike price you chose. In this scenario, I chose 150 (closest strike price to 146.92). If the price drops to 140 during the time period, you are still getting MSFT for 150.    

However, if you had done a simple limit order, you would be paying 146 (probably within the day you made the order). You don't get the 12 dollar premium on 150 - making your breakeven price 138.   

*Leg 2: Sell stock*   
Years pass. Seasons change. The old strong oak withers and the young sapling emerges from the morning dew on a fresh spring morning, in the latter years of your life.   

It's time to sell the MSFT stock you were banking on retiring with. MSFT is now at $248.20, and the economy is steady thanks to the efforts of president Beiber.    

How do you sell MSFT traditionally?
Write a slightly in-the-money call with a near-term expiration date.   

We don't know what the prices are today for this, but let's assume we are going to pull the same thing we did on the purchase.   

Normally, we would make a Sell Limit Order at $248 and sell the stock.   

What we do instead is write a call option for  $245, expiring 51 days later. A $12 premium per share is paid to us for the option. The option is in-the-money and will be assigned at some point.    

---    
*So whats the catch?*    

You are getting a premium paid that limits your entry and exit points. You won't get the extra 50 bucks if MSFT suddenly ""moons"" to $300 during the period that you want to sell. You still get your $245 per share and the premium.

If the price moves away from the strike price you could miss the buy or the sale. You would still get paid the premium, and can write another option, for another nice, juicy premium.    

*What does all this mean?*   
It means you are being paid for selecting a buy and a sell price. If you know what you are willing to pay for the stock, and what you will accept to sell it - and hold fast to those prices,  you get a premium return as a reward.

You have sold the ""dream"" prices of a $50 buy and $300 sale to the speculators. Only they will reap the excess rewards of your stock if something crazy happens to the share price in a short period. People on WSB and speculator discord channels will pay you a healthy chunk of cash to use your shares betting on moonshots that typically will lose them money.    

Flakey investors will chase prices up and down with limit orders, and are not getting the premium price afforded to people who choose their prices and stick with them.     

*Options are dangerous and can lose tons of money!*   
False. Options can create leverage or reduce leverage. They can be the safest or riskiest investments, depending on how you build your spread. This bull spread strategy actually reduces your leverage.

You are actually reducing your exposure and risk to the market. Stock buyers who use a basic limit order are paying more money for the ""unlimited gain"" possibility.   

If you plan to buy MSFT and sell MSFT anyways, you cannot lose money writing options in this way."

2020-03-26,ffriendzone,7,Why does it seem like certain stocks/sectors move together? Is there a correlation with algorithmic trading?,"A question I've wanted to ask for a long time: I notice that certain stocks will move together in similar directions at certain times of the day - more noticeably at the times with highest volume/volatility (like at open).

I'll watch a handful of stocks at open - and often times if one of them breaks through a resistance and moons, a number of others will move up with it. TSLA and NIO are a pair that I notice will do this regularly. Also TSLA and MSFT will have similar sentiment at certain times too. I'm sure it happens with many others as well, these are just a few that are fresh in my memory.

It reminds me of when I used to trade crypto -- if a bullish trend was happening.. a good number of my altcoins would go up together.

It's not always the case.. I could be looking into it more than necessary but I would like to have a better understanding of this if anyone has any insight - thanks !

edit: i should mention that this pertains to my particular situation of daytrading.. seeing breakouts on the same 1 or 5 minute candle of two separate stocks is ultimately what drives this question."

2020-03-26,sellside_sandy,27,Market Outlook - March 2020,"Hi guys, just want to share with you my current market outlook. Hope this can help spur a discussion for everybody's benefit. This is not a an investment advice. You are not my client and I am not your fiduciary. That said, the views below are just for discussion purposes.

At the risk of being cliche and obviously wrong, here I go:

**Short term-medium term:**

1. We are in a bear market, and recession is already underway.
2. Occasionally, there will be ""bear market rallies)"". For long term investors, these are not a time to buy **yet**, use it to sell instead. For traders, bear market rallies and the volatility that they bring, are great opportunities to make money. Dow Theory suggest there could be at least three bear market rallies within the overall bear market trend.
3. Reason why I think the downturn will continue for short-medium term: The USA is still early in the coronavirus infection blow out. Look at updated chart by JP Morgan and FT [here](https://ibb.co/tsSwJcg) and [here](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest). The Fed is doing everything they can to keep liquidity/market functioning. The fiscal stimulus that the government is trying to pass, should dampen the blow to the economy. But, as long as the coronavirus situation i.e, the public healthcare crisis, the real crisis, is not tackled immediately through decisive action like other countries, then it will only prolong the infection period. See Bill Gate and WHO's opinions [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/bill-gates-us-missed-its-chance-to-avoid-coronavirus-shutdown.html) and [here](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-who-sees-potential-of-us-becoming-new-coronavirus-epicenter/). IMO, the market is still underestimating the coronavirus infection and the blow to the economy that it could bring given ineffective measures by the government.
4. The market could at least fall for another 15% before it starts to find a bottom based on previous bear markets.

**Longer term:**

1. Stocks would eventually go into bull market again.
2. Among the indicators that signal bottoming/reversal would be volatility (VIX) returning to normal level.
3. High quality companies, I would imagine mega-tech with pristine balance sheet, would rally first and perhaps perform the best in the upcoming bull market.

**Asset Allocation**

***Short term***: Short equity via inverse ETF, short emerging market stock/currency - especially countries with twin deficits (fiscal and trade), long gold, long treasury. Or just stay in cash.

***Risks:*** As what happened previously, gold and treasury did not provide the hedging characteristics. They went down together with stocks, while in normal condition, it they should go up. One possible explanation is that funds are liquidating any positions that they could, to satisfy redemption and margin call.

***Things to avoid: 1)*** **Options**, because options are currently trading at premium in general due to high implied volatility. Also remember that with options, you have to nail three variables to make money - direction, magnitude, and time horizon. Also, avoid **2) triple leveraged ETF/ETN.** The volatility and leveraged used in the ETFs will cause a ""decay"" in your return if the market trade sideways. As for ETN, their prices could fall to certain level that trigger ""acceleration event"" in which case, the investment banks issuing the ETNs will redeem the ETNs from you, usually at a steeply discounted price.

***Long term:*** Long equity, with overweight on mid-mega cap tech stocks."

2020-03-27,SeriousLeague,2,"""Priced in""","I see a lot of comments justifying market moves up an down based on recent news already being priced in.  We can all agree that peak corona virus is at least a week away and will last for an unknown amount of time.  For those who think the market will continue to rise or that we haven't yet seen the bottom because the apocalypse is upon us, what are you basing your price targets on?

Before the virus hit, the S&P 500 had an earnings yield of about 4% which was arguably over-valued compared to the 10 year treasury rate of about 1.6%.  The treasury yield is now sitting around 0.8% so in my opinion an earnings yield of 4% for the S&P 500 is about right. Some of the most bearish forecasts are calling for a 30% drop in earnings for 2020 followed by a recovery in 2021.   If you take the bearish 30% earnings decline forecast you get an S&P 500 value of about 2400.  2400 ignores the fact that in the following year earnings will likely increase 30%.

tl;dr It's possible that the stock markets are fairly valued despite the avalanche of bad news about to come in the next week in regards to COVID-19 cases and unemployment."

2020-03-26,sharsenij14,5,"Interactive brokers, execution, commissions, and paper trading","Hi. I am trying out different execution algos with Interactive Brokers (paper trading mode).

First, I noticed that it allows me to place VWAP and TWAP orders. However, they start showing up as overfilled in the live orders tab on TWS (e.g. Quantity 2200/2000). I know this might be something very specific to the IB system, but I was wondering if anyone else tried using these orders in their paper trading account. Do they actually sort of work, or is it best to stay clear?

Second, I see that my simulated commissions for the TWAP order are taken out for each time slice. I mostly intend to trade mixed lots (e.g. 297 shares) over the course of the entire day. It looks like TWAP slices it into 10-20 smaller orders with a commission minimum applied to each. Would I pay a lot less in commissions if I just try to fill that 297 share lot as single Market-on-Close order?

On a more philosophical note, what order type do you think is best for my trading style? I have a systematic strategy, approx. 300 positions (L/S cash-neutral) with daily rebalancing and 3-week portfolio turnover. Importantly, most names I trade are small and micro-cap stocks. The simulated account size is $1M. Right now I am debating between a simple Market-on-Close vs. entire day TWAP / VWAP with an attempt at price improvement. For reference, today I tried a TWAP order from Noon to 3.30pm and ended up paying \~$0.01 / share in commissions for a marketable order. Instead of doing these marketable TWAP / VWAP orders, I should at least try to offset what I assume are increased commissions by attempting a midpoint, or last close buy, right? And if the TWAP order doesn't fully fill with those restrictions, I can top it off with a Market-on-Close order towards the end of the day (?)

Not sure if this is the wrong forum to ask these questions as some of it is pretty specific to IB and their trading platform. But I feel that any advice from you guys would be super helpful. Thank you."

This  somewhat aligns on when is the earliest we should expect a vaccine --   18 months from when the Chinese shared the coronavirus RNA, in January,   is June 2021.

Of course, one can  accelerate that if there's some kind of unexpected acceleration to  recovery, such as a vaccine delivered earlier than expected that is  safe, effective, and deployable on a global scale.

2020-03-26,Randomness898,9,"Look at pairs trades for good buying opportunities, don't wait to put it all at what you think bottom will be","If people have followed my posts they know I'm way more less apocalyptic than most people here. In fact here was my only post here from last week where I said we could be close to the bottom. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/fjtkzh/we_are_very_close_to_the_bottom/

I think the 225 region for SPY is a pretty solid floor, so I think even if we do go back down, it won't be a lower bottom than last week. 

Anyways the reason I post this is you can be a bull and a bear at the same time. A lot of people for some reason only buy like SPY or an index fund, but you should look at individual stocks, you can see some interesting opportunities. 

Here's an interesting one. SPY was at its ATH eod Feb 19. 

LVS eod on Feb 19 was around 69 dollars. As I'm typing this (12 pm EST 3/26), LVS is 52.5 dollars. 

Google eod on Feb 19 was 1518. As I'm typing this, Google is 1145 dollars. 

LVS is down 23.9% in that time. (16.5/69 for the calculation)
Google is down 24.6% in that time. 

Now does that make any sense to anyone? No. So anyways that's the point. I don't think you should hold out all your money waiting for the bottom (nice job if you time it right but it's actually not possible to time it 100%). You want to put money into good stocks. 

The fact that LVS now has dropped less than Google from SPY ATH is utterly garbage. So you can be a bull and a bear. Obviously if you were looking to buy something here, you would choose Google any day of the week. 

You can subsititute Google for any number of tech stocks who have been hit around 25% at this time from ATH. 

Sure can Google go down? Oh yea if SPY goes down, it'll go down. No doubt. But you can't time that! That's why start putting in a little bit of money and do it in good stocks like Google and like crappy stocks like LVS who have now rebounded more than tech stocks for absolutely no reason. 

I assure you if you start buying some Google or Microsoft or some good stock, you'll be up at some point in the future. Oh yea sure if SPY goes down, these stocks will go down, but how do you know how much and when it'll go down? If you use my logic and read my post last week, you actually would have made like 10-15% on SPY already and more on individual names (and locked it all in today). So yes we are likely to go down at some arbitrary point in the future, but if it doesn't go back down again, you just missed out on a lot. Think about it, not buying last week could have potentially cost you 10-15%. Yes you might get another chance if we do go back down the 10-15% again, but how do you know it'll do that? You don't, so buy good stocks like Google or Microsoft that are clearly mispriced to garbage stocks like LVS or one of those hard hit stocks that's gone up necessarily.  

Point is: start buying good stocks in increments at a time, don't buy garbage stocks like LVS which are clearly mispriced vs tech names. If I were a permabear (which I'm not), that's a stock I would short (put spreads) actually over SPY. So you can be bullish and bearish at the same time!

2020-03-26,correct_misnomer,6,Data Asymmetry,"Before I start I just want to clarify that this post is not about whether the market will go up or down. Instead I want to discuss why it is silly to think the average investor can predict volatile markets such as the one we are currently experiencing.

Big banks, hedge funds, institutional investors, etc., have a huge information advantage over the general public through their data aggregation. They are able to purchase large amounts of data for so many different scenarios. They are looking at data that many of us have not yet even considered relevant to the current situation. Many of them are already processing this information, understanding how it will effect the economy (with the help of people with actual degrees in economics), and updating their projections for market performance.

I’ve seen so many people on posts today frustrated and confused as to why the market is jumping after jobless claims were released. Most people calling it a bull trap already. However, as I see it, the average investor simply does not have any place in judging the current market behavior. The first step to investing is to assume you know nothing. For every idea you have, theres a 100 other people thinking the same thing, as seen by the sheer disappointment in this subreddit following the jump today.

In short, there exists a massive data asymmetry between the general public, and large trading firms. In some cases, where the data is not particular telling (lacking a strong signal), the public may be able to take advantage of speculation. But, in most cases, the information advantage that large firms have, leaves the public basically in the dark, regarding current market conditions."

2020-03-27,acm0044,0,Change my view/tell me why I’m an idiot,"This opinion is controversial and I haven’t found many that share this belief so I very well could be trying to outsmart the room. 

I am bearish long term on 3/5 FAANG stocks. 

Facebook: Their revenue is almost entirely ad based and social media tends to be cyclical. As people become more tech savvy ad blockers and other programs preventing ads/cookies will become more popular, available, and easy to use. As less people see ads on Facebook they won’t have as many buyers for ad space and will not be able to demand as high of a price. The millennial generation which I belong too have largely moved away from Facebook as a primary or even secondary form of social media and I do not see its popularity continuing to rise over time. It’s business model does not seem well suited towards long term growth and I could see it peaking in the next few years. (Yes I know that is still a long term investment I am holding this opinion in the perspective of companies I would want to own for 10+ years). Not to mention they’ve had some issues with user privacy and allowing shady news articles/companies to advertise on their platform.

Google: This one is a harder case to make as they have one of the strongest balance sheets of any company out there. They have also been extremely popular for a long time and have a lot more software they can monetize. My biggest issue with them is again the percentage of their revenue from ads. I don’t see a peak for them in the foreseeable future, but I see more growth opportunity in a lot of other companies without significantly increasing risk. They also do not pay a dividend so you entirely rely on their growth for returns which I could see slowing over the next few years. 

Netflix: They were the original king of streaming, however I think their competitors have caught them in many respects. Content wise it’s fairly easy to make arguments for other streamers such as Hulu, HBO, Amazon prime, or Disney+ as having better content. Netflix is losing rights to some of its most popular binge shows like The Office and in terms of original content Disney and HBO are still setting the bar. Their release model of allowing the entire season to be streamed immediately also limits their ability to market a series and build hype around it. It also allows some of its stingier customers to create trial accounts to binge watch a show and never sign up. Right now they are thriving off their expansion into foreign markets and the moat that is their customer base already  subscribed. I think over the next few years they will start losing subscribers as the competition surpasses them and people begin to reassess how much they are paying a month in streaming services. 




These are all opinions and I am not taking positions based on them or recommending anyone do so. I am currently looking at some stocks to buy for the next 10+ years and these were some of the first I crossed off the list. So now for the fun part where you guys get to make fun of me and tell me how dumb I am.

2020-03-26,std_enable_if,55,"Investing psychology: do people who make more money care less about getting the ""best"" returns?","I realized that when I was a college student, I was pretty obsessed with getting 50-100% returns a year, often taking on big risks to do so. I was trying to time the market, using leveraged ETFs and options, buying and selling VIX products, and buying high risk/high reward stocks.

After graduation, I got myself a pretty decent job, and I've been maxing my 401k into an S&P500 mutual fund regardless of market fluctuations without a care in the world. I'm also buying stocks that I like outside my 401k that I think have great future potential through DCA, without much regard to their price movements. I feel like I'm making so much as a 23 year old compared to my peers, that even if my investments underperform, I'll still be doing relatively well later in life, so returns matter less. Like, for example, if I have 0% returns for the next 40 years, I'll still probably be able to amass 5M by the time I'm 65 assuming I get no raises, which would be 2.3M inflation-adjusted at 2%. In a HYSA, it'd be 5M inflation-adjusted. That's definitely enough, and I have no care about getting more than that. I also don't have a target retirement age - more like if I have enough for 3% SWR and I don't care much about working anymore I'll retire.

I did a little poll with my other high-earning friends, and they share similar opinions, mostly just DCA away, but when we were in college, we would be thinking about shit like XIV, and how to short the VIX spike, etc.

What does r/investing think? Are the market timers mostly people who are earning less and think the stock market is a way to get ahead? I hypothesize that there's a correlation between earning more and taking less risk when investing, and probably why the really rich folks put some money away in hedge funds that return less than the market but with less volatility.

EDIT: if you want to make moral judgments on people for not “humble” and for not be comparing with peers head over to r/selfimprovement"
2020-03-26,street-guru,5,$LULU estimates way too optimistic ahead of results tonight,"Management is likely to sound quite cautious this afternoon when they release their Jan quarter results after the close. Analyst checks indicate unprecedented y/y markdowns and declining average price of SKU's. While this trend should be expected in the current environment, street estimates will likely come down after results.

Current street estimates do not appear to fully take into account the store closures and distribution center closures to comply with local government restrictions. Margins will also likely come under pressure. For instance, LULU recently opened a 23k sf store in NYC and a 20k sf store in Chicago (big costs). Both will likely just sit for weeks/months with states implementing shelter in place initiatives to fight COVID-19.

Perhaps more concerning is that the magnitude of estimate revisions may be quite wide ranging because management likely will not issue guidance for 2020 under the current uncertain environment.  So while LULU has greater e-commerce penetration than some of its peers, it will not be immune to pressures in 2020.

Consider selling LULU before the close today, then buying it back over the coming days if the stock gets hammered."

2020-03-26,hello-world-foo-bar,0,One Metric To Rule Them All | South Korea | Coronavirus Spread Characteristic,"We all know that the coronavirus is what's moving markets. Moreover, we are all betting on how fast the virus will take to bend the curve. So far only China and South Korea have bend the curve.

Each country has applied two different approaches based on their political makeup. China applied a forceful authoratarian approach. Literally, locking people in their homes. While South Korea has applied a soft lockdown with widespread testing that is aligned with it democratic society. So we shall look at South Korea's metric to determine some characteristic of the spread in this model.

The data set is shown below.

[https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/south-korea/)

What the dataset shows is that the South Korea is had bending the curve, ***but it is at risk of a new reinfection cycle***. Imported cases and community spread are increasing.

[https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200326003354320](https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20200326003354320)

The implication is that we should focus on South Korea over the next couple of weeks to see, if it experiences another cycle of reinfection. If so, we can conclude that the duration of the virus will be a lot longer in soft lockdown models. And we can extrapolate this long erduration, flattening of the curve, to the US & Europe.

The financial impact will be that the soft lock down may be around for 6 months. And when they are about to be lifted, the winter cycle (October 2020) starts, and lockdown will have be to be applied for 2021.

0 global economic activity for 6 month has not been priced in and this is what will push markets past their recent lows.

However, if South Korea does show a strong bend of the curve, then the soft lockdown will work, and the US & Europe will follow suit, and lockdown will be lifted in 2 months.

So just follow South Korea to understand the chacteristic of the virus in a soft lockdown model."

2020-03-25,hotrodfantasy,224,CNBC: Negative rates come to the US: 1-month and 3-month Treasury bill yields are now below zero,"The coronavirus crisis has brought another first to U.S. financial markets — negative yields on government debt.

Yields on both the one-month and three-month Treasury bills dipped below zero Wednesday, a week and a half after the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark rate to near-zero and as investors have flocked to the safety of fixed income amid general market turmoil.

It was the first time that happened in 4½ years, when both bills briefly flashed red and yields fell to minus-0.002% each. The readings Wednesday were well below those.

“This is part and parcel of the whole flight to quality thing,” said Kim Rupert, managing director of global fixed income at Action Economics. “They’re obviously the most liquid instrument. We saw a lot of selling pressure a few days ago when everyone was selling everything to get cash. But with all the plans the Fed has introduced, the bill market is much safer.”

The U.S. now joins large swaths of Europe and Japan that also have negative-yielding debt.

In Germany, the move was even more prevalent, with all government fixed income instruments except the 30-year bond carrying rates below zero. Denmark, France and Sweden are among other European nations also in the category.

Negative yields are largely a function of demand, as prices and yields move in opposite direction for bonds. Investors pay a large premium above par on the bonds and can receive less than their initial investment at maturity. Deposit rates also can be negative.

The negative rates, however, are not directly related to central bank policy. Fed officials have rejected the notion that the U.S. central bank might eventually take its policy rate below zero.

However, that might not matter if current market trends hold. While longer-duration Treasurys are still a good ways from negative territory, the trend for yields is lower.

“There’s no telling anymore in this environment. They could spread,” Rupert said. “Everyone is expecting the Fed to be lower for longer, and I mean longer.  The whole bias is for yields to go lower. I would not rule out the front end of the curve going negative.”

“Ladies and gentlemen, we are done. We have a deal,” White House aide Eric Ueland announced at the Capitol just after midnight.

White House officials said the measure will cost about $2 trillion.

Negotiators worked all day, with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and incoming White House chief of staff Mark Meadows shuttling between meetings with Republicans and then Democrats.

The package includes direct deposits for all Americans, $367 billion for loans to small businesses and an unprecedented program that will allocate $500 billion to the Treasury Department. Some of that money will be used to guarantee a Federal Reserve loan program for small and medium-size businesses. Larrry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, said the funds could be leveraged into $4 trillion of lending through the Fed.

Most adults would receive direct payments of $1,200, while children would see $500 checks. Hospitals would receive some $150 billion under the deal and small businesses would get $367 billion in aid.

Due to restrictions on large gatherings, the general meeting of shareholders to approve certain matters for the deal to go through has been postponed to June 30, Mylan said.

There were no other changes to previously announced terms or plans pertaining to the deal, previously expected to close in mid-2020, the companies said. 


The merger, which will bring blockbuster treatments Viagra and Lipitor from Pfizer under one umbrella with Mylan's EpiPen, is part of years-long effort by Pfizer to split into three parts - innovative medicines, lower margin off-patent drugs facing generic competition and consumer healthcare.

The combined company is expected to have 2020 revenue of $19 billion to $20 billion.

2020-03-27,std_enable_if,0,Unemployment numbers are front-loaded and the rate of increase will diminish,"I work in high finance, and now that the day's done and the information priced in, I can lay out my thoughts. Businesses that weren't viable in the current market quickly laid off people, unlike in previous recessions.

Historically, when economic growth slows down, businesses would gradually lay off employees in proportion to how much they need to cut costs in a feedback loop. Less sales this month, lay off more people, and repeat; vice-versa in good economic conditions. This would play out with new unemployment numbers gradually becoming larger and larger.

This time, most businesses that had lay offs *know exactly* what their revenues are going to be like in the next month or two: close to zero. They anticipate this, and lay off everyone, because why pay people and bankrupt your business when the state will give everyone free money?

Now, who's left to be laid off when all the businesses that came to a sudden halt already laid off everyone? If you followed, you'll come to the conclusion that new jobless claims should be diminishing after today's. In fact, the bigger today's number, the better it would have been for the stock market. If you want to exercise your brain a bit, you can think about why before reading ahead.

=====

Businesses that laid off their employees will still be in business after all this is done. Businesses that try to play hero when they have zero revenue will bleed to death. The laid off employees will be paid by the government, and shouldn't have too much of an impact - they'll live on. Hence, the bigger the jobless claims early on, the healthier the business environment will be once things re-open again."

2020-03-26,IIUSA,0,Can trading platform be sued for loss due to margin department actions,"I recently had a margin call issued for a stock that I was shorting. The call was issued at 5 am in morning. The message I received gave me time till the end of the day to meet the margin requirement by covering my position or adding funds. But instead of waiting for me to do anything, margin department covered my short position at a loss of $6800 before 10 am that very day...what made things worse was the stock fell to near my selling price within an hour of margin department covering my short position. In that scenario, my margin requirements would be met without anyone needing to do anything. Instead due to trigger happy nature of the margin dept, I have a negative balance on my account.

So I feel I am being wronged by the trigger happy nature of the margin department. Can I sue them for causing me loss by not honoring deadline they themselves set? They could have at least called me if they though they couldn't wait till the end of day, which they didn't. Can I take this to court? ... or is there any other way I can talk to trading platform to reduce my loss by not crediting all of it to my account and instead take some blunt themselves? Is there another way where I don't have to go to court and also not bear all the loss myself?

Thank you.

PS: I am aware of the user agreement that allows margin dept to take action, but then what's the point of giving a deadline if you are not going to honor it.

2020-03-26,thomasbatey,0,"Re-investing strategy to ""recover losses quicker"", too good to be true?","Hello guys and girls

I have this re-investing strategy idea, which kinda sounds too good to be true, so I want to share it for a more diverse scrutiny.

I started investing at the beginning of this year, and my portfolio value got smashed. The total investment value was over $100k, but now it's down about 40%, to about $80k.

Initially I just wanted to invest long-term, to ""make my money work for me"". However, during the first few weeks I noticed that the profit of some stocks going up was way too good to leave it untouched (sometimes way over the value of the quarterly dividend), so I kept selling to lock profits, and re-purchasing afterwards (at a higher price; basically scalping, but with a long-term perspective). I kind of transformed myself from an investor into a trader, with some days having over 50 transactions, sometimes for only a few dollars profit each. But it added up, I was about $5k in profit over my initial deposit just 6 weeks in. However, with the market crashing, prices going down meant there wasn't anything left to scalp (I am talking about long positions -- I am not interested in shorting as I have lost way too much money, sometimes barely hitting the ""stop loss"" limit only to see stocks going south a lot afterwards -- unlike scalping longs, CFD shorts brought a lot of anxiety in my daily life (beside $xx,xxx losses) and I am not interested in getting more of that :) ) 

Back to my strategy. Today for example, I had about $9000 to ""play"" with and I managed to ""scalp"" about $200 profit (an average of $5-$10 per trade). I am thinking I would do much better if I sold everything and ""played"" with a lot more cash, to basically recover the value of the shares through the volatility of the market. I am doing this while assuming the market is close to (or already hit) the bottom (in Europe it's much worse than in the US, with some stock down even 70+%). Unlike the crash, volatility of the stock on the way up would work a lot in my favor, because I would constantly buy each dip and sell every profit I can take. Then re-buy the lowest valued stock, sell for profit, rinse and repeat. It's not uncommon to see 10% rises one day, followed by a 10% drop the next in many European stocks. This also applies to the US market, but I think that one might not have hit the bottom yet, given the relaxed attitude towards the increasing number of infections there. There is a good chance that America gets F-ed into oblivion, with the way Trump is handling things (just a personal opinion).

So, my question would be, instead of waiting for stock to go up to previous values (which might take years), should I just sell and scalp my way back up with a lot of smaller transactions? With a big investment, I can probably recover a 40% loss in less than 6 months, if the market is volatile enough. I don't mind doing it, as I have plenty of time and it keeps my boredom away, so this would not be a problem. I have to mention that, aside from the buy/sell price spread, I am not paying transaction fees with my current broker (etoro).

So, where is the flaw in my strategy?

Thank  you"

I've now initiated a transfer out of all my money after being unable to trade and missing out on great deals on several stocks that would have netted me thousands of dollars over the past 2 weeks.

2020-03-25,Rabbitloki,221,Why next week's unemployment numbers are likely to be worse than this week's,"We are preparing for potentially the worst unemployment numbers ever on record this Thursday.  However with the Stimulus package now passed businesses across the US can now examine whether they have funding in order to retain employee's or if they'll need to trim immediately in order to survive.

For Small businesses which represent \~$9.4B or \~44% of the total US economy they are clearly the biggest losers in this stimulus package unless CNN has made a major misread.

***The bill would ensure the Small Business Administration could serve as a  guarantor for loans of up to $10 billion for small businesses to ensure  they can maintain their payrolls and pay off their debts.***

[*https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-senate-action-coronavirus/index.html*](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-senate-action-coronavirus/index.html)

Small businesses employ 58.9 million people, which makes up 47.5% of the country’s total US workforce.

Accounting for the projected 2M employees in the first round of layoffs we can easily assume that half of these are from large companies.  This leaves us a potential 57.9M small business employees now on the chopping block.

Another 5% reduction this upcoming Thursday seems very reasonable if not low given small business owners are quarantined around the country and have nothing to do but look at their outgoing cash expenditures.  This represents 2.9M layoffs in next Thursday's unemployment numbers.

**Folks, Welcome the largest layoffs in history... Next week will be worse**

Cash or Short... Calls are completely insane for anything other than day traders."
2020-03-24,coffee-trader,1269,"Don't be misguided, markets bottom will be signalled by low VIX and actual economic data, not huge rallies","Today is pure optimism and the reaction to good news (or what looks like good news). Fiscal stimulus is anything but certain by tomorrow, FED is doing unlimited QE, and Trump thinks the US can open up by Easter.

Fiscal stimulus takes time to kick in and for many people and businesses comes a week too late. It helps putting money in the pockets but doesn't suddenly restart the economic apparatus -only consumer and investment confidence do that.

Unlimited QE is like fishing with dynamite: quick results but a lot of underlying damage. lts worth noting that this is not a financial crisis but a public health crisis with financial implications. The FED can at best alleviate some symptoms but that's it.

The US is not testing nearly as fast as Korea (17 times less tests per capita when I checked this weekend), nor is it taking the lockdown serious. Unless a million tests appear by this weekend so the virus can be traced and narrowed down, Trump has to face the reality that he either locks down fully now or blows this crisis out of imaginable proportions in less than a month by opening.

So in my opinion, how does a bottom look like? 20-30% drop from the current level, with decreasing volatility starting in one or two weeks when the spread of the virus becomes more clear and the economic data hits us hard. Shy but ever more common gains and then more big rallies than drops (but not 10% if that's what you want).

We've only had one VIX spike, in 2008 there were 3. Also plenty of examples of fake rallies like today's and the first Friday of the month. The sp500 was grossly overpriced in February, so whatever it fell until the first days of March was barely an overdue correction. Now you have to input recession to get the true dimension of the collapse.

Disclaimer: this is just my opinion and I'm not offering investment advice

Edit: just to clarify I don't expect vix under 20 this year. When I say low I mean 30s perhaps 40s. I also know markets recover before clear good news begin. When I say let the economic data hit us I'm talking of at least having an actual dimension of the problem, so March and April readings."

> “I don’t have a need for an equity stake,” Calhoun said in an interview Tuesday with Fox Business. “I want them to support the credit markets, provide liquidity. Allow us to borrow against our future.”

2020-03-25,street-guru,23,"$FB estimates finally coming down, 1H weakness a potential buying opportunity","Street estimates are finally beginning to come down with the company acknowledging yesterday that its ad business is weakening in countries where aggressive actions are being taken to fight COVID-19. Since US/Canada and Europe alone represented over 50% of last quarter's ad revenue, clearly the majority of the ad business is now under pressure.

FQ1 revenue growth estimates now range in the low-to-mid teens, down from low 20s prior to the pandemic. Use of WhatsApp and Messenger has more than doubled in countries hardest hit by the virus, but these are not properties that FB monetizes currently, although Instagram could be a source of potential upside with Instagram Live views also doubling. Regardless, the 10-15% decrease in ad spending from travel and films industries in Mar likely more than offset the usage increase across FB's apps.

COVID-19 is likely to get worse for FB since the economic impacts and advertising pressures in the US and Europe are months behind Asia. Also, since FB has no exposure to China, its Dec and Jan ad revenue trends do not represent a lead indicator for Mar and Apr. Since 50-80% of US TV ads are contractually agreed to in May of the previous year, large advertisers can't cut TV ads. FB's ads on the other hand are sold through real time auctions and are thus much more easy to cut.

All that said, a bigger pullback from weak 1H results could present a nice buying opportunity for the stock because the company's strong fundamentals are intact long-term. The FCF yield on F'21 estimates is now over 6% up from \~4.5% before the pandemic."

We were up over 7% if I recall correctly, and the days following were strong too. 

We may be seeing a little bit of that now. Volume was healthy today, and we are less than a week from quarter end, just like last time. 

I'm not particularly bullish on this market, but that could be a strong technical buying trend that pushes us higher as long as there's not more-catastrophic-than-expected news. Also, we have a number of positive tailwinds - Italy cases flattening, bill passing, fed kicking in finally.

Anyone see anything that looks distinctively pensioney, like those giant block trades in '18? (I don't know why some people can't learn to use VWAP, unless the whole point is to cause a melt-up). I also wonder if Tuesday was this at work...  But, pensions would still be under-allocated significantly at these price levels, and might be shy to pull the gun with inv grade credit markets really broken a few days ago, but gradually improving. 

Anecdotally, I have several high net worth friends who wanted to rebalance this week but could not because they couldn’t get fair values for individual bonds they have. I have to imagine a lot of that is corporations also dumping their fixed income securities to have cash on hand or switch to t-bills.

Text only:

With airline stocks in precipitous decline and details of a bailout being hammered out this minute, I've spent the past two weeks trying to better understand the longer-term profitability (or lack thereof) of the airline industry. Warren Buffett, America's favorite ruthless grandfather, famously joked about the airline industry in 2008:  
*Here a durable competitive advantage has proven elusive ever since the days of the Wright Brothers. Indeed, if a farsighted capitalist had been present at Kitty Hawk, he would have done his successors a huge favor by shooting Orville down.*  
I like to describe airlines as a capacity-commodity industry: profitability of the industry rests primarily not on the growth of the underlying market (the demand for travel), but on limiting supply (in this case, the number of airplane seats in the air) to maintain pricing.  


We see this precarious dynamic across many capacity-commodity industries: companies carefully expand production capacity, wary of sparking build-out wars. Samsung, commenting most recently on their Q4 earnings call, would rationalize their expansion of NAND (the chip used in solid-state drives) capacity very carefully, trying not to scare competitors into believing there would be industry oversupply:  
*Regarding our investments going forward, the base that we are operating in is that the demand we're expecting, as we mentioned during the presentation, is around mid-10% growth for DRAM and mid to high-20% growth for NAND. Basically, our default is to meet the demand growth through process migration as well as using our inventory. Now to answer the hypothetical question that you posed about, for example, this year, demand going far over what's expected overall, then we will have the option, for example, to respond to market demand flexibly using Phase 2 of Pyeongtaek or Phase 2 of Xi'an, these new fabs, so that would be an option in that situation that you've proposed.*  
Notice what Samsung is actually saying here: ""We can meet some demand through process node migration (Moore's Law), and we did kind of overproduce last quarter, so we have these leftover NAND chips and we'll sell those too. Oh by the way, let's just address this hypothetical question you've asked, for which we've already spent $2.3bn USD, that if demand were higher, we would produce more. Hypothetically. Not saying we're doing it, even though the fab is already online, just that we're ready."" What's worse, SK Hynix (the other leading NAND manufacturer) says much of the same thing: ""We'll produce more...if there's more demand!"" The two companies try to maintain face in the market by signalling a somewhat cooperative environment, while simultaneously attempting to sneak away and grab a little bit of market share. Everyone is trying to cheat their way, just a little bit, to higher profitability. As Samsung and SK Hynix demonstrate, all capacity-commodity industries are really multi-billion dollar games of [""just the tip""](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Just%20the%20tip).  


Similar to the NAND industry, which consolidated from five major players to four after the implosion of Elpida, the merger of Continental Airlines with United Airlines in 2010, and the merger of US Airways with American, shrank airline the industry to three large players (United, American, and Delta), with four tiny players (JetBlue, Southwest, Spirit, and Virgin) resulting in route consolidation and highly-profitable small-airport destinations (i.e., a flight to Buffalo NY has a higher price-per-mile than a flight to Chicago).  


Buffett describes this industry consolidation and collusion in his typical bullshit-folksy way, after taking an 11% stake in Delta Airlines:  
*It’s true that the airlines had a bad 20th century. They’re like the Chicago Cubs. And they got that bad century out of the way, I hope.*  
I really hope to one day learn to communicate in the non-threatening way that Buffet does (Magic 8-Ball says: ""Outlook not so good.""): he manages to entirely elide the overwhelming tendency of oligopolies to engage in widespread price and capacity collusion.  


There are a bunch of subtle ways that airlines can collude to restrict capacity. One approach, as alluded to by Delta in what I can only describe as the greatest big-brain-energy play in the history of collusive behaviors is as follows:  
*We at Delta were the only airline back in 2012 that voluntarily capped our carbon footprint at 2012 levels.*  
This is an evil-genius-level play. Since emissions are primarily driven by fuel consumption and fuel efficiency, Delta is de-facto signalling capacity restriction by signalling carbon footprint restriction. These people are evil geniuses, for managing to combine eco-friendly virtue-signalling with industry collusion, all in one neat, tidy, totally legally defensible claim that probably can't be litigated against.  


Another (arguably) legally-defensible approach would be for all airlines to pledge 85% of their earnings to dividends: airlines that cut their dividend (in order to grow fleet size), would see their stock immediately punished (since their dividend was cut), and dividends of this magnitude would prevent fleets from growing, thereby enabling stable industry capacity and profitability. Dividends would have the added benefit of preventing poorly timed share repurchases: the fact that UAL and DAL have cut share repurchases exactly when their stocks are cheapest is all I need to say here.  


Unfortunately for shareholders, airline CEOs are generally paid in options (which don't pay a dividend), and therefore, airline CEOs have a tendency to favor share buybacks, which, if you recall from our article [""How to be a shitty investor""](http://theyieldblog.com/stonks), are only good in limited circumstances.  


The biggest driver of airline capacity however, is no longer fleet size, capital allocation decisions, or emissions, but airport landing and takeoff slots: the scheduled time a flight is allowed to arrive and depart at a specific hub. These slots are effectively ""timeshares"" in the literal sense, and are owned by a specific airline, while being sold/coordinated by airports.  


Most US airports are near-capacity, so for an airline to gain a foothold in a new hub, an existing airline must approve it. This obviously leads to incredibly profitable horse-trading shenanigans (the horses are airport slots): like collecting specific properties in Monopoly, airlines will trade slots until a duopoly of airlines control the slots at each airport. This game of Monopoly even has a name: ""hub premium"", the higher price that passengers tend to pay when an airline has consolidated a significant percentage of overall slots at a single airport.  


Hub premiums and slotting are the real reason Buffett loves airlines: in good times, they can no longer be their own worst enemy, and are limited in capacity expansion through limited airport slots, and can even gain extraordinary pricing power in hubs they control (some online whitepapers have shown that the hub premium can be as high as 10-20%, which is effectively the entire profitability of the industry).  


In 2000, the Wendel H. Ford Aviation Investment and Reform Act for the 21st Century (Air-21) attempted to curb this behavior and attempted to ensure that new entrants had ample access to airport facilities and slots, stating that ""major airports must be available on a reasonable basis to all air carriers wishing to serve those airports"".  


In order to encourage airports' cooperation in opening up airports to ""all air carriers wishing to serve those airports"", Congress made federal sources of funding contingent on compliance: blocking passenger facility fees (up to $4.50 per ticket) in government subsidies should an airport fail to comply. Note that these fees would go to the airport, not the airline, as obviously airlines would otherwise happily eat a $4.50 loss to reprice by an extra $100-$200.  


Unfortunately for consumers, this law only applies when an airport is responsible for ""over 0.25% of all enplanements"", which means that smaller US airports are incredibly profitable for incumbent carriers that have no requirement to give up their slots.  


Analysts ask about slots on conference calls, and you should notice from the following JetBlue earnings call how closed-lipped leadership is being here: no carrier wants to tip their hand on how negotiations are proceeding.  


Hunter Keay of Wolfe Research to JetBlue management:  
*...can you update us and where you are on obtaining slots?*

  
Stephen Priest, JetBlue CFO:  
*Again, I'll pick up the aircraft side of things. And then I'll get Joanna to give an update on the wider perspective with regard to slots. We remain confident in our plans to continue to grow relevance in both New York and Boston with the European expansion. Great amount of planning underway and again because of the close cooperation with Airbus we are confident with the delivery timeframes around the A321. So I'm going to Johanna to give a better perspective in terms of - our perspectives in terms of slots et cetera.*

  
Joanna Geraghty, JetBlue COO:  
*...We continue to work multiple paths around slots and a number of London area airports were confident that our London plans can work in any number of airports. And we'll update you when we have a bit more information to share.*

  
The New York Times has some interesting stories showing how incredibly hard it is to break into an airport for a marginal player:  
*Virgin, for instance, has found it difficult to expand in big airports controlled by its rivals. The carrier tried for three years to get into Chicago O’Hare International Airport, where United and American Airlines own most of the gates and would not part with them. Eventually, the airport bought a concourse once operated by Delta and opened it to new entrants, allowing Virgin to establish six flights a day between Chicago and San Francisco. “They weren’t interested in another competitor,” said David Cush, Virgin America’s president. But Virgin is still finding it hard to get landing slots at Newark Liberty International Airport, controlled by United. As part of its merger with Continental, United sold some landing and takeoff slots in a private sale to Southwest Airlines that left Virgin out of the loop. As a result, United is still the only airline to offer a direct route between Newark and San Francisco.*  
You'll also notice from that article that only marginal airlines like Virgin are willing to comment: slot control is so important to major players that their representatives generally avoid all comment.

Slots appear to be the most strategically important property of an airline: they inherently restrict airlines from competing each other to death. Buffett is right as usual: the first 100 years of airline growth were uncapped by airport slot constraints, which are now preventing airlines from becoming their own worst enemy. To the upside, I see an enormous opportunity for airlines to be far more shareholder-friendly by enacting aggressive capacity restraint through dividend signalling and carbon emission control. To the downside, airlines will continue to face more regulation: airlines touch a broad base of political constituents and their long-term profitability is fundamentally capped by consumer ire and regulatory oversight.

If you've ever wondered if antitrust regulation is truly helpful, consider this: Berkshire Hathaway has over $124bn in cash or T-bills, and without regulation Buffett could trivially acquire all five US airlines with no external financing, consolidating airport slotting across every airport and gaining monopolistic pricing (I can hear Warren's heavy breathing), and single-handedly float their working capital needs. With regulation, new entrants will be able to gain footholds and compete if pricing gets too far out of wack. Ultimately, the answer to the question of long-term US airline profitability rests almost exclusively on regulatory oversight: with peak travel demand in non-Corona times exceeding airport capacity, US airlines will be as profitable as they can get away with.  


**Are airline stocks worth owning, right now?**

The airline bailout memo paints the exact picture we would imagine:  
*Pessimistic: $26B (67%) net drop in liquidity for A4A passenger carriers alone in the first 6 months of 2020 to $12.8B. By end of 2020, they will have dropped $53B (135%) to a deficit of negative $14B. In this scenario, all seven of A4A passenger carriers run out of money completely sometime between June 30 and the end of the year. Making matters even more urgent, credit card companies would likely begin withholding cash from sales before the carriers actually run out of money, effectively causing carriers to run out of money earlier than June 30.*  
Credit card companies ""witholding payment"" to the major airlines is an absolutely blood-chilling statement. There really is no precedence for this situation: in 2009, Delta still served 188bn revenue passenger miles with 82% passenger load. At its peak in 2019, Delta will do 237bn revenue passenger miles. We have literally *never* seen a true decline in air travel in the US, not even from 9-11. However, we do have real data, from Chinese airlines, for this exact crisis!  


**China Southern Airlines March 18 Press Release:**  
*In February 2020, the Group actively responded to changes in market demand, timely adjusted its operation strategy, optimized its capacity allocation and reduced some flights. Passenger capacity (measured by available seat kilometres (“ASK”)) of the Group decreased by 73.07% as compared to the same period last year (a year-on-year (“YoY”) basis). Of which, passenger capacity for domestic, regional and international routes decreased by 74.31%, 91.05% and 69.34%, respectively as compared to the same period last year. Compared to the same period last year, passenger traffic (measured by revenue passenger kilometres (“RPK”)) decreased by 85.11%. Of which, passenger traffic for domestic, regional and international routes decreased by 85.95%, 95.92% and 82.69%, respectively as compared to the same period last year. The passenger load factor was 47.11%, representing a decrease of 38.11 percentage points as compared to the same period last year. Of which, the passenger load factor for domestic, regional and international routes decreased by 38.77 percentage points, 41.86 percentage points and 36.92 percentage points, respectively, as compared to the same period last year.*  
Holy shit. This is awful. An 85% decline of revenue passenger kilometers for passenger flights. There is almost no way the US airlines get out of this without massive shareholder dilution in addition to loan guarantees. I am likely not a buyer at $20/share for Delta, the largest and best-run of the airlines.  


While Delta is better-positioned than United, **their working capital ""backdraft"" is simply too high**: flight refunds will absolutely devastate their liquidity. Delta had $47bn of annual revenues in 2019, so consider the possibility of Delta seeing $5bn-$20bn of pending refund requests (my wild-ass guess) while having only $2bn of cash for refunds, and $40bn of opex ($11bn of which is salaries, and $2bn of which are landing fees), the fixed costs of Delta still massively outweigh existing liquidity: I estimate the working capital suck to be so high that Delta and others may need a second bailout should this disaster last 18 months.  


Airlines are sort of like very fragile insurance companies or banks: they float/""lend"" an enormous amount of money ($50bn of revenues / $44bn opex for Delta) while being worth very little (Delta is valued at $13bn on the day of this writing). Airlines have been walking a very wobbly tightrope over the past 5 years, and falling off has meant a $50bn federal bailout, which vastly exceeds the amount the industry used to repurchase shares over the last 4 years. Airline profits should be tucked away for leaner times, but instead are wasted on overvalued shares, making their share price rise almost illusory.  


Ironically, the US Federal bailout's plan to block stock buybacks for US airlines should actually be great for investors in the long-run: were someone to buy shares today and hold until results normalized, airlines will be able to return cash to shareholders at incredibly high yields (as a percentage of cost basis). Delta prints $7/share in earnings in a peak year but pays only $1.50 in dividends. Post-bailout, we can imagine Delta's share count doubling (and share prices halving) from massive equity dilution. Imagine a world where Delta is forced to distribute $3.50 a share in dividends on after you paid only $5-$10 a share.  
One can only dream.  


I'm a buyer of post-bailout DAL at $8/share."

Just read that the FED has agreed to a $2trillion QE deal to pump liquidity into the markets. 

This reminded me of a paper I read a while ago about the effect of QE on Corporate bond prices. The paper suggested that QE raises (inflates) the price of Bonds. See excerpt below: 

&#x200B;

>By implementing QE, the central bank steps in, inflates bond prices and improves liquidity by making it easier for investors to sell these risky illiquid assets as part of the bond buying programme, thereby reducing the risk premium and lowering bond yields. The drop in yields and the increase in liquidity could potentially reduce risks in the system by removing problematic assets from banks’ balance sheets and by contributing to deleveraging.

And thus I am wondering if, as retail investors we should've been buying bonds a week ago in the hopes that we can offload these on the market once this QE thing gets started.. 

Am I right to think that, or am I missing something as usual? 

Thanks

2020-03-24,throwaway2134274,52,Suncor energy reduces oil sands production as Canadian oil prices collapse to $8.54/barrel,"  [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rare-step-oil-sands-giant-180056744.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rare-step-oil-sands-giant-180056744.html) 

(Bloomberg) -- Record low prices for heavy Canadian crude have prompted one of the biggest operators in the oil sands to take the rare step of shutting production.

Motivated by the “extremely low” prices, Suncor Energy Inc. announced on Tuesday that it will shut in one of its two so-called trains at its two-year-old, 194,000 barrel a day Fort Hills oil sands mine. The company also is delaying the start up of its MacKay River oil sands wells to May, after operations were halted in December because of a malfunction and fire.

The move comes as the coronavirus pandemic slashes worldwide oil demand just as Saudi Arabia ramps up oil production in a price war with Russia, sending global oil benchmarks to the lowest prices in almost two decades. Western Canadian Select, the oil-sands benchmark, fell to $8.54 a barrel, which will be a record low if it settles at this price, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The value of the bitumen itself, excluding the light condensate that’s added so the heavy crude can be pumped through pipelines, was valued at just $3.83 a barrel.

Oil sands wells and mines are built for billions of dollars to last for decades. They are rarely shut because many of their operating costs are fixed and, for the wells, leaving the reservoirs cold for an extended period of time could cause damage. Suncor and its partners Total SA and Teck Resources Ltd. agreed to operate the single processing stream at Fort Hills at full utilization to increase cash flow amid the low prices for bitumen.

The guidance for Suncor’s share of Fort Hills bitumen production in 2020 was reduced to between 55,000 to 65,000 barrels a day from between 85,000 to 95,000 barrels a day, the company said in its release.

The use of one train at the mine “will increase cash flow, particularly when bitumen prices are extremely low, as we are able to significantly reduce variable costs,” the company said. “Unit costs for the remaining production will be higher because of this decision as a result of fixed costs being covered by lower volumes.”

(Adds Fort Hills production guidance in second to final paragraph)

Their goal is to finish the studies first, and then if those are promising, to have enough of the drug able to be manufactured for the most advanced/high risk patients.

Orphan drug status is normally designated for rare diseases. This will become political quickly, as GILD is a part of the president's task force, and will be seen as nepotism or cronyism. I'm sure they will get lambasted in the media if the cost of the drug is prohibitively high, or if there is limited supply of the drug. There is certain to be limited supply.

Again, studies are not out until April, hopefully early in April. It's very likely these could come out in late April. In February, analysts determined the windfall from this potential FDA approval would only land Gilead 2.5 billion in conservative estimates.  



Tldr: this will get ugly and political if this drug is approved by the FDA and gileads drug is effective against the Wuhan clan. If you're going to buy Gilead, buy it for their immuno oncology pipeline, or for their Blockbuster HIV franchise. Or buy Gilead because of their healthy cash flow, or their strong balance sheet. Or buy it for their cash horde. If this becomes a windfall for GILD, they're going to need to price their drug at 200 a month or lower to avoid regulatory scrutiny."

2020-03-24,TheHiveMindSpeaketh,61,"Airports, not airlines, are the rebound play for air travel","I will begin by saying I AM AN AMATEUR RETAIL INVESTOR AND NOBODY SHOULD EVER TAKE MY ADVICE FOR ANYTHING RELATED TO INVESTING.

With Boeing and the airlines running to the USFG for bailout money and share prices in the tank, a lot of people are starting to poke around tickers like $UAL, $DAL, $LUV and $BA thinking that there is a lot of value to be had. This is largely on the theory that air travel is part of the backbone of the world economy and, whenever the crisis subsides, there will inevitably be plenty more money to be made in this industry.

That is definitely true, but I don't think that trying to go for individual airlines (or even Boeing) is the right way to chase this opportunity. The reason is that these companies go through bankruptcy and restructuring all the time. United, along with several predecessors to Delta, have done so as recently as this century. If these companies end up having to drink from the government trough, especially with the widespread public sentiment *against* further bailouts, a wiping out of the existing shareholders seems to me to be a real possibility.

*Airports*, on the other hand, seem to me to be a much more exciting opportunity. Most American investors don't think about airports as an asset class because all airports in the US are publicly run. Outside the US, however, there are a number of publicly-traded airports that are run privately, often on a concession basis. Airports are a much more natural monopoly than airlines and, since most airports get much more attractive margins than airlines, tend to have better balance sheets and therefore face a much lower possibility of bankruptcy or restructuring.

Airport stock prices have seen similarly drastic haircuts as the major airlines, but seem much better positioned for a safe rebound than airlines. I am personally invested in $PAC (a collection of Mexican airports) and $AUKNY (Auckland NZ), both of which have seen >50% drops from their recent highs, and am rapidly expanding my positions at these low prices. In anything less than an end-of-the-world scenario, air travel *will* return to its highs and continue to grow, and airports' revenue numbers should bounceback at the same time."

2020-03-25,EagleWolf9,10,What are the Consequences of a Stock Market Bailout by the Federal Reserve?,"This is what I understand in layman's terms. A treasury bond is a type of loan the federal reserve takes from investors. The interest in that loan is the profit made by investors. Now, this is how I understand repos. An institution or even the federal reserve takes a loan via cash and uses securities i.e. T-bills or treasury bonds  as collateral (because these have value). The institution or fed repurchases these securities at a later date, usually overnight, for a higher rate. Now I have a few questions about this:

1. When news outlets report that the fed has pumped x trillion amount of money into the stock market via repo operations, what does that exactly mean? To my understanding, these transactions happen all of the time in the repo market, so how do these securities circulate through the stock market in order to alleviate the selling pressure we are currently seeing?

2. (This will sound like a noob question). Where does the federal reserve get its money to repurchase its securities?

3. Is it possible that the federal reserve defaults on its loans, causing a treasury bond bubble burst?"

This time the cuts are much bigger (13-15% cut for Mar quarter, 15-20% cut for Jun quarter) now that there is greater visibility to the supply chain disruptions in China for much of the Mar quarter, as well as the demand pressures in China for most of the Mar quarter spreading to the rest of the world starting late Feb.

Analyst checks on global smartphone shipment data indicate a 38% y/y decline for Feb, which is the largest decline ever. Expectation now is that the demand pressures will persist in North America (US \~45% of sales) and Europe (\~25% of sales) for most of the Jun quarter as China begins to slowly recover. While Macs and iPads should arguably do better than iPhones in this environment of learn/work from home, technology purchases in general are currently far from consumers' top of mind.

All the bad news near term aside, the long-term bull thesis for AAPL remains intact. AAPL has \~$100bn in net cash, generated \~$64b in free cash LTM, and has \~20x interest coverage ratio - it is as safe as any company can be in weathering this pandemic, not to mention its flexibility for buybacks.

With the influx of the same topics over and over, I’d like to post this as a little catch all:

1.	We don’t know if the markets will continue to go down. Review Cr suggests that we still have further to fall due to the increasing number of deaths worldwide as the virus spreads and due to people being unable to work. I would think (but don’t know for sure) that we have further to fall.
2.	should you invest now? Maybe? Probably? No? It all depends on your risk tolerance. One the one hand, the world is on sale. On the other, we may have much further to drop, so your portfolio won’t be looking like it would have during the previous bull market.
3.	Should I invest in XYZ? Maybe, it all depends on your risk tolerance. Maybe read a few books on the topic rather than getting investing advice from a 5-min reddit post and basing your life on that.
4.	I’m a bit and hold index fund invest. I don’t try to beat the market. That is my own personal decision. I cannot tel you if this is the best for you without knowing your investment goals. I don’t hold any individual stocks at this time, but again that is my own personal decision.

2020-03-24,TheProdigalS0n,6,$OXY,"Virus will be over one way or the other in 3-9 months. Saudi/OPEC versus Russia oil trade war will end in the coming months as both nations have had their economies damaged by the virus and require massive stimulus so they cannot squander both their currency and oil reserves needlessly on a prolonged price war. Even if they did want to prolong it, they do not have the storage capacity to hold the excess supplies from: (1) destruction of market demand even after we recover; (2) short term cancellations of oil shipment contracts due to virus; (3) the insane amount of excess oil they’re now pumping on the market; & (4) world economies/travel coming to a complete standstill under quarantine. This oil price will not be long. 

Energy stocks had been battered prior to collapse and weren’t overvalued compared to tech stocks, so when energy stocks lost 70-90% of their value they were still at a relative discount compared to other sectors. Even worst case scenario economy/productivity/trade/travel only rises back to 70%-90% by year’s end, you assume $OXY will retract gains in its stock price : (1) jointly as economic activity normalizes and quarantined areas are lifted in phases as $OXY was trading above $40 approximate one month before virus hit; (2) OXY raises dividends again as business normalizes and it is able; and (3) OPEC/Russia end the price war and cut production to increase prices. You have Icahn increasing his position, while Buffet also holding a position in $OXY. Long the market. Trust in man. I’ve bought September 2020 and January 2021 calls at a $10 strike. Godspeed.

EDIT: I take a long term macro realpolitik analysis in my trading. Energy (much like Boeing, auto, etc.) is a vital national security interest. I believe this stock is poised for rebound based on the factors above, but I also hold a firm belief that worst case scenario: (1) a lifeline will be thrown to US energy through loan restructuring: and/or (2) $OXY will be prime for takeover by a rival which will also increase the price. Worst case and only if needed I believe it likely $OXY will be able to restructure any debts to longer repayment terms, but I guess my detractors believe cruise ships and rental car services are more vital to national security than energy independence as we enter into this new post-globalism era where vital supply chains/resources (e.g. energy, pharma/med manufacturing, etc.) are protected & repatriated for national security and public safety.

Moreover, although the US is in for major pain over the next 4-8 weeks, other areas of the world where the virus has ran through are starting to see positive developments. It’s time.

2020-03-24,RiEiDiIiTiSiUiCiKiS,4,US Dollar to be crushed DD," 

""... To get around this problem, a recent [IMF staff study](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2018/08/27/Monetary-Policy-with-Negative-Interest-Rates-Decoupling-Cash-from-Electronic-Money-46076) shows how central banks can set up a system that would make deeply negative interest rates a feasible option.

**How low can you go?**

In a cashless world, there would be no lower bound on interest rates. A central bank could reduce the policy rate from, say, 2 percent to minus 4 percent to counter a severe recession. The interest rate cut would transmit to bank deposits, loans, and bonds. Without cash, depositors would have to pay the negative interest rate to keep their money with the bank, making consumption and investment more attractive. This would jolt lending, boost demand, and stimulate the economy.

When cash is available, however, cutting rates significantly into negative territory becomes impossible. Cash has the same purchasing power as bank deposits, but at zero nominal interest. Moreover, it can be obtained in unlimited quantities in exchange for bank money. Therefore, instead of paying negative interest, one can simply hold cash at zero interest. Cash is a free option on zero interest, and acts as an interest rate floor.

...

**Breaking through zero**

One option to break through the zero lower bound would be to phase out cash. But that is not straightforward. Cash continues to play a significant role in payments in many countries. To get around this problem, in a recent [IMF staff study](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2018/08/27/Monetary-Policy-with-Negative-Interest-Rates-Decoupling-Cash-from-Electronic-Money-46076) and previous [research](https://www.imf.org/~/media/Websites/IMF/imported-full-text-pdf/external/pubs/ft/wp/2015/_wp15224.ashx), we examine a [proposal](https://www.nber.org/papers/w15118.pdf) for central banks to make cash as costly as bank deposits with negative interest rates, thereby making deeply negative interest rates feasible while preserving the role of cash.

The proposal is for a central bank to divide the monetary base into two separate local currencies—cash and electronic money (e-money). E-money would be issued only electronically and would pay the policy rate of interest, and cash would have an exchange rate—the conversion rate—against e-money. This conversion rate is key to the proposal. When setting a negative interest rate on e-money, the central bank would let the conversion rate of cash in terms of e-money depreciate at the same rate as the negative interest rate on e-money. The value of cash would thereby fall in terms of e-money.""

With this in mind, I was wondering why some companies have such large discrepancies between the two. For instance, Salesforce is trading at a price to book of $35 a share, while its price to tangible book value is about $5 a share. What's more, some companies like JNJ have a positive price to book and a negative price to tangible book. 

Am I missing something in my understanding of the concept, or do these companies just heavily value their IP, patents, and goodwill? If so, is there any reason that I should take their word and value those things at the same rate that they do? Is there a way to check how honest they are being? Or does it just make more sense to trade on tangible book?"

This might prove problematic for Saudi Arabia's strategy of flooding the market with oil as there's literally no one to buy it and their decision to reserve a huge number of tankers has [made freight rates too expensive](https://www.reuters.com/article/global-oil-floatingstorage/saudi-arabia-tanker-power-play-could-backfire-as-oil-demand-shrinks-idUSL8N2BC7LA).

Additionally so far there has been no increase in product supplied out of Saudi Arabia, which is technically in line with their guidance and maintenance of the prior cut agreement but might is bringing some doubt about their willingness to follow through.  Article: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-saudi/despite-opec-deal-collapse-saudi-oil-exports-yet-to-rise-sources-idUSKBN21A321

Additionally Russia might [already be backtracking](https://www.reuters.com/article/oil-opec-russia-tatneft/update-1-russias-tatneft-says-wrong-to-raise-oil-output-in-april-tass-idUSL8N2BG818) a bit from their previously aggressive posture about immediately raising production in April.

Saudi Arabia and the United States are also in talks to find some other way to stabilize the oil market which might include an alliance between the two: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-oil-usa-saudi/u-s-saudi-alliance-one-of-many-ideas-being-discussed-u-s-energy-secretary-idUSKBN21A2WW

We're still early into this by any measure but it does seem like it's less and less likely that anyone has the resolve or really the ability to actually hike output in the current demand environment.  I suspect we might see everyone reapproaching the table sooner than expected if the US can get shale producers to reduce output by even 5-10% which they might be doing anyways at this point given the cuts to capex budgets and layoffs we've already seen.  Things could fall apart again tomorrow but it does seem like there's some reasons to believe this might not end up being quite as bad as previously threatened at this point."

* Equity market returns over the last week broken down by industry and sector
   * Evidence that companies with the biggest exposure to default risk are getting punished the most by the market
* Equity market returns by region
* Net debt vs. profitability analysis: Highly profitable companies before the crisis with low debt are doing best
* Strategies for ""optimists"" vs. ""pessimists""
   * Optimist: if you believe the recovery will happen in months rather than years
      * Bargain Basement: Find large caps with low debt and high profitability before the crisis
      * Distressed Equity: Treat extreme bargains like OTM options. Nine out of ten might go out of business, but your loss is small. One might make a triple-digit% turnaround and make up for all your small losses and then some.
   * Pessimist: if you believe the recovery will happen years rather than months
      * Safety at a Reasonable Price: Large cap companies that will prosper in a slow-growth economy.
      * Change Agents: You expect fundamental changes in society and the economy, like a shift towards telecommuting being the norm rather than the exception, find companies that will benefit from these shifts.

2020-03-24,Leapfrog25,0,Why Bailing out Companies is Necessary,"Hi all,

I’m sorry if this is simplistic, but it really helped for me to have it explained. So on Reddit and on other sources of news I have been noticing outrage towards the fed and government around monetary policy and corporate bailouts. I listened to yesterday’s addition of “The Journal,” a free podcast from the Wall Street Journal which helped me understand what exactly is going on and made me feel less upset. 

So in a nutshell, we have many businesses losing their revenue streams and laying off workers. If a business is not generating revenue, suddenly other businesses who provide services to this business such as landlords or utilities end up losing their revenue as well. Consumers who lost their jobs can’t spend on recurring payments like Netflix, cable, utilities, internet etc. So loss of revenue in a small number of industries has reverberating affects throughout the entire economy. 

Many businesses have a revolving line of credit, a predetermined amount of money that can be taken out from the bank as needed for unplanned expenses. The problem, is that all the companies seeing these reverberating effects are prematurely tapping this line of credit. Banks have a limited amount of money that can be loaned out therefore creating a cash-flow crunch. Since the demand for loans is  so high, banks are actually charging higher interest rates due to limited supply. That’s why the fed is stepping in to support corporate debt.

Based on this explanation, it makes perfect sense as to why the government and the fed is obligated to step in here. The repercussions of inaction are higher than of action.  It’s easy to point the finger at corporations for being irresponsible, but hey the government forced companies to close and the media spread panic like wildfire."

2020-03-24,Citizen00000000069,12,Drawing credit lines vs issuing bonds,"Many companies are drawing down their entire credit lines to raise cash to sustain them through this crisis. It seems there are three ways for companies to raise cash right now:
1) Draw down credit lines
2) Bailout
3) Bond issuance

I'm wondering why we haven't heard of anyone doing #3. #1 would probably be the cheapest and fastest, so they've done it. #2 will likely have burdensome strings attached. Why haven't I heard of anyone doing #3? For example, why is Boeing asking for a bailout over issuing bonds? I understand the bond market is pretty seized up right now, but what are the other reasons companies aren't using it as an avenue to survive? I don't know how long it takes for a company to go through the process of issuing new bonds so maybe it's not an option. What am I missing?"

2020-03-23,COMPUTER1313,87,Reuters: SoftBank plans $41 billion of asset sales to expand buyback and cut debt,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-buyback/softbank-plans-41-billion-of-asset-sales-to-expand-buyback-and-cut-debt-idUSKBN21A0F2

> The buyback tops the $20 billion of purchases sought by activist investor Elliott Management, which has put pressure on SoftBank to improve shareholder returns, and will retire 45% of the group’s shares. 

> SoftBank’s share price has been hammered by investor scepticism over the outlook for Son’s bets on start-ups such as WeWork and Uber (UBER.N). 

> Monday’s announcement comes after SoftBank’s conglomerate discount - the difference between its market capitalization and the value of its assets - yawned to a record 73% last week. 

> SoftBank’s financing options are becoming increasingly constrained, however, as domestic banks hit internal limits for lending to the highly leveraged group. 

On a side note, Saudi Arabia was a major investor of Softbank's funds:

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-softbank-group-investment/softbank-executive-flags-some-50-winners-in-100-billion-vision-fund-idUSKBN2062NU

> The Vision Fund, which is backed by Saudi Arabia, had invested $74.6 billion in 88 companies by the end of December, at which point those investments were worth $79.8 billion.

> These include Uber Technologies (UBER.N), Chinese ride-hailing firm Didi and WeWork, the office sharing start-up whose initial public offering imploded last year.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-investment-pif/saudis-pif-invested-in-50-60-firms-via-softbank-fund-director-idUSKCN1MX12X

> The Public Investment Fund, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, has invested in 50 or 60 companies via SoftBank Group’s (9984.T) Vision Fund and will bring most of those firms to the kingdom, managing director Yasir al-Rumayyan said on Tuesday. 

> The state fund has agreed to invest $45 billion in the giant tech fund led by SoftBank and the pair are also working with other parties on a number of large-scale, multi-billion dollar projects relating to the solar industry."

2020-03-24,Aeronomotron,12,Why is VPU (Vanguard Utilities ETF) considered a high risk investment?,"I am a newbie investor, but I have been learning more about the financial world as of late. It was my understanding that, in general, utility companies are seen as lower risk, low growth, high dividend yielding companies. That information seems controdictary to the fact that over the past 10 years, this ETF has yielded 12% annualy, and vanguard classifies it as a high risk investment. It isn't leveraged, and the companies that are held would probably qualify as large cap utility companies. That specific ETF is getting crushed right now, but most stocks are in general. So, is my understanding about utility companies incomplete or wrong? A quick google search on this topic iterates my initial understanding. What am I missing, and what do you think about utility ETFs in general?"
2020-03-24,hshshajshsh,1,IMVT Technical Trade,"**IMVT US**

**IMVTW US**

Immunovant Inc (formerly known as Health Sciences Acquisitions Corporation) is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on enabling normal lives for patients with autoimmune diseases.

As this is a technical trade we will ignore fundamentals, IMVT currently trades at $9.24, IMVTW Warrants (Sold in ½ Common Shares) trade at $1.01 ($2.02 per share).

The warrants have a strike price of $11.50, are excisable as of May 14th 2020 and expire in 12/18/24, an extremely long timeline for a biotech stock.

Valuing the warrants using 50 vol, would yield a value of $4.25. If we were to use the historical vol of 78% the value would be closer to $6.12.

It is worth bearing in mind the warrants are redeemable, at the Company’s option, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, and if, and only if, the last sale price of the Company’s common stock equals or exceeds $16.50 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period.

The creation of a listed options markets should serve to increase warrant valuations through enabling investors to sell calls against their warrants, furthermore just the presence of a market should boost warrant valuations. In order to create the market there would need to be 2000 individual shareholders. 

Therefore the trade idea would entail the purchasing of a single share and purchasing warrants at massively discounted price. **With a listed option market the warrants could be worth $5 more than doubling in value.** 

If the share price does rise above $16.50 the trade would yield $3 profit (150%) in addition to any return gained from selling calls. If the price remains below $11.50 the warrant holder could either sell at a fair valuation or could profit from 4 years of selling options."

This is the reason why they tell us to *diversify*


I see the attitude of investors in their comments and it is quite obvious they can’t stomach their current exposure to the market.


I just read a comment on another thread, * “I’m losing money by holding” * 


No shit. And we all made a killing since 2008 by holding. This is the game. There must be downs. It is part of the process. We will profit because people will break traditional investing rules.



People are saying “this time it’s different”
THATS WHAT PEOPLE SAY IN EVERY RECESSION AND BEAR MARKET. Capitalism will find a way to make it work. If it doesn’t, then none of our money means anything anyway.


When all this dust settles, every one of us should take the time to reflect our thoughts and most importantly actions during this time.  Your actions - did you panic sell? Did you try to time the market and lose?

2020-03-24,rgotor,0,Life Insurance,"This may be just marginally related to investing.

But I'm wondering: assuming 50% of the millions which *could* die for the virus have life insurance, will the insurance companies be able to pay out? 

How large is the safety margin in their calculations?

In the worst case, the virus would  infect 70% (natural herd immunity effect) and roughly 8% of those would die (medical system overload) multiplies out to 5.6%, let's round down to 5%.

The usual death rate (all causes) is roughly 8% per year.

So 5% is significant.

Assuming there are such payouts, would they have their own effect on the economy?"

I thought this was massive news. At first glance it looks like a  case of what we don't know can't hurt us, but the official line is that this move is to prevent traders acting on out of date information.

The move has promoted speculation they're planning for a contingency full shutdown of the markets, which to me seems a much more likely scenario. I mean since when did investors need the sort of protection they're talking about? 

The official line seems silly considering it's pretty blatant that Q1 reports won't have taken into account the full impact of the Covid-19 shitstorm and that any future projections at this point are akin to pissing in the wind.
