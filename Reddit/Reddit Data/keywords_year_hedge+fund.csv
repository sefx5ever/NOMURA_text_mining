2019-08-17,TigerKingz,27,For Fun: Who is the secret Hedge Fund backing the GE short ?,"  

Just for Fun I wanted to put his post together (as a speculated guess) to uncover the Hedge fund backing the GE short.

It was recently disclosed that Harry Markopoulos has disclosed a potential accounting fraud in GE. He is backed by an undisclosed Hedge Fund.

I believe this hedge fund to be Pershing Square Capital Management (PSCM) Bill Ackmans fund because;

   
 

1. PSCM recently took a position in Berkshire Hathaway. (one of the biggest; best capitalised and most liquid insurers in America). GE is exact opposite, one of the worst capitalised insurers with little tolerance on the balance sheet for write downs, economic downturns and questions around the capital reserves.

The BRK position would act as the natural hedge to the GE short position.

If not GE what else is the hedge for his Berkshire trade??? PSCM is a hedge fund after all.

   
 

2. PSCM has been hit with reputational damage and regulator issues on the Herbal Life short in a past trade. 

Bill has mentioned in the media that he will be reluctant to approach a stock short in the same manner as Herbal Life due to reputational risk and also the risk that regulators are reluctant to investigate a company as the shorting Hedge Fund profits from the mere appearance of an investigation. 

To mitigate/avoid this risk, Bill has said instead PSCM will disclose in private to the regulator rather than make public disclosure. Markopoulos has said the regulator was informed before the August public disclosure.

   
 

3. Where is Bill Ackman? 

Normally Bill is in the media discussing/detailing the PSCM new positions. 

Also, in my opinion, Bill would likely oblige the media by publicly disclosing to the market that PSCM is not the Hedge fund shorting the GE stock, given point 2 above.

Bill's absence from the media is quite telling me.

Using Markopoulos to publicly disclose the trade is a shrewd/novel way of getting around this. 

   
 

4. Why would a Hedge Fund care if their publicly short a beaten up stock like GE?

Isn't the point of Hedge Funds to be long and short stocks and be market neutral - see point 2.

(I will defer that regulator issues may be one).

   
 

I did think the PSCM was the most likely from T+6hrs from the first disclosure so I may have had inbuilt bias. But we will see. This is just for fun with bit of logic and public knowledge, no more than Markopoulos has done for his research. 

(It really doesn’t matter who the Hedge Fund is)

   
 

Let’s hear your ideas or criticize my points."

2020-03-19,ltdshred,19,Bridgewater hedge funds fall further on coronavirus market rout,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-bridgewater-idUSKBN21539W

(Reuters) - Bridgewater Associates LP, the Ray Dalio-led hedge fund giant famous for making money during the 2008 financial crisis, has posted double-digit losses so far this year amid sharp market declines sparked by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a note sent to clients on Wednesday and seen by Reuters. 

Through March 16, Bridgewater’s All Weather 12% volatility “risk parity” fund fell about 14% for the year; its Pure Alpha 18% volatility hedge fund declined about 21%; and its Major Markets 14% volatility hedge fund dropped about 7%, Dalio wrote. 
Dalio wrote that the performance was “not what I would want” but was “consistent with what I would have expected under the circumstances.” 
Bridgewater has assets under management of about $160 billion, according to its website, and is trusted by some of the world’s largest investors to safeguard their money no matter the economic environment. 
The S&P 500 index tumbled 7% on Wednesday, triggering a 15-minute trading halt of Wall Street’s main indexes for the second time this week, on fears that stimulus measures may not be enough to avert a coronavirus-driven recession. 

Dalio said Bridgewater’s portfolios were positioned for relative economic strength but also had hedges on in case of an unanticipated steep market decline. The firm’s risk controls worked as designed, he said, adding that Bridgewater remained liquid and able to adjust its positions. 
“Going forward, the world has now crossed a very dangerous threshold for financial markets and economies that poses great risks for all investors,” Dalio wrote, citing interest rates falling below zero percent amid an economic downturn, inequality and populism. 

“It is one we have been preparing for for a long time.” 

CHINA RUMORS 
On Wednesday, Dalio posted on popular Chinese microblogging site Weibo to dispel rumors about a Bridgewater blow-up. 

“There has been a rumor going around China that Bridgewater has ‘crashed’ or ‘is in trouble,’ Dalio wrote, attaching the client note with the firm’s performance and views. “You have my word that that is totally false and that Bridgewater is totally safe.” 
He condemned “bad people” who spread such rumors. “I think we might have identified the rumor monger which we will pursue legally and disclose publicly if we are able.”"

Article behind paywall so here you go:

Solus Alternative Asset Management, one of the best known specialists in distressed investments, is closing its flagship fund after suffering a combination of heavy redemptions and poor performance.

The hedge fund, which as recently as November managed $4.3bn in assets, is one of the first casualties of a collapse in the price of riskier assets this week. In a letter to investors in its Sola vehicle on Tuesday, the firm offered them the option to transfer their investments into new funds or face “an orderly liquidation” that would return their funds “as soon as practicable”.

“Due to the evolving state of the markets, this has left our flagship fund Sola with a high concentration of less liquid assets,” the letter said.


The Financial Times reported in December that Sola had suffered big losses after making a number of ill-fated bets on companies including satellite operator Intelsat and Pacific Gas and Electric. The fund finished the year down more than 8 per cent, after a 15 per cent drop in 2018. It had assets of about $4bn at the turn of the year.

Solus’s letter to investors said that “unexpected withdrawal requests” had followed reports of the firm’s difficulties in the financial press.

The company declined to comment.

Solus emerged as one of the most high-profile distressed investment firms in the US after its skirmish with Toys R Us employees in 2018 and a legal battle over derivatives with a Blackstone-owned hedge fund, GSO Capital Partners.

Now, though, it has become a victim of a string of corporate collapses that have tripped up US distressed investment funds, which look to profit from buying stocks and bonds of struggling companies at bargain prices.

Shares in Intelsat, a heavily indebted satellite group popular with hedge funds, collapsed as much as 75 per cent in November after a US regulator rejected its plans to raise money by selling off its airwaves. Some of the company’s bonds are now trading at about one-third of face value, as bondholders are braced for a potential wipeout.

Shares in two of Solus’s other equity investments, US coalminer Contura Energy and offshore drilling services group Hornbeck, both dropped about 90 per cent last year.

An investor report from January showed that 22 per cent of Sola’s exposure was to “energy equipment and services” companies: a sector that has been hit by a growing distaste among investors towards fossil fuels and, more recently, a sharp fall in the oil price.

Many other distressed specialists are smarting from bets on energy-related companies turning sour. Blackstone’s GSO faced ruptures in its distressed investment unit last year, for example, due in part to bad bets on ailing oil and gas groups, such as Oklahoma-based Tapstone Energy.

Investors who stick with Solus face two options.

They can switch over to what the firm calls a “long-term opportunities” fund that looks to invest in thinly traded assets. Alternatively, they can lock up their investments until 2021, by which time Solus will sell its illiquid holdings and reinvest the proceeds in more easily tradeable assets."

It's the 2nd worst year of this streak: net openings were -149, vs -328 in the worst year, 2016. Overall, more than hedge-funds 4,000 died during this streak.

The S&P 500 performed exceptionally well, delivering a 28% gain this year through November, while hedge-fund returns were poor, with the Bloomberg Equity Hedge Fund Index at only 10%. These are poor returns in an absolute sense, not just compared to S&P performance. In other words, even if S&P performance was average, these would be poor returns considering the high management fees charged by hedge-funds. January through November 2019 saw a total flow of $81.5 out of hedge-funds.

The article contains a list of notable hedge-funds that shut down this year. You'll notice some pretty well-known names in that list, including a Citadel fund:

MUNICH (Reuters) - Hedge funds control 35-45% of the shares of German lighting group Osram ([OSRn.DE](https://www.reuters.com/companies/OSRn.DE)), posing a headache for Austrian suitor AMS ([AMS.VI](https://www.reuters.com/companies/AMS.VI)) as the investors may press for the $5 billion offer to be sweetened, a person close to the matter said on Thursday.

FILE PHOTO: The logo of German lighting manufacturer Osram is illuminated at the company's headquarters in Munich, Germany, September 16, 2019. REUTERS/Andreas Gebert/File Photo

An initial bid by AMS to create a global leader in sensors and lights stumbled last month when it fell short of the necessary shareholder backing. Since then AMS has lowered the acceptance threshold to 55% to try to get the deal over the line, while keeping the offer price at 41 euros a share.

Osram Chief Executive Olaf Berlien told German daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung that some investors seem to have no intention of tendering their shares by the Dec. 5 deadline.

“It appears that a number of hedge funds have acquired shares with the aim of selling them at a later date and at a higher price,” he told the newspaper, which first reported the stakes held by hedge funds.

German law allows for courts to determine that minority investors be compensated at a higher price for their shares when an acquirer and a target company strike a so-called domination agreement, which regularly prompts hedge funds to hold back shares aiming to benefit from a deferred sale.

However, if too many speculative investors decide to hold back shares that can lead to deals falling apart, as seen in initial failed attempts for a leveraged buyout of generics firm Stada. That deal eventually went through in 2017 after the offer price was bumped up.

AMS - which already controls 20% of Osram - said on Wednesday that 3.3% of Osram shares have been tendered so far.

On Oct 31, hedge fund Sand Grove Capital Management disclosed a 5.75% Osram stake.

Around 10% of Osram shares are held by exchange-traded funds, which according to German law, are not allowed to sell their stake as long as the takeover is not completed, banking sources have said.

Retail investors, which often ignore tender offers, hold 20%-25%, the sources have said."

2019-06-24,eeg_bert,1,Modeling the World Class Return Profiles of Venture Capital vs. PE vs. Hedge Funds,"I'm trying to model the approximate return profiles of *world class* venture capital/PE/hedge funds (i.e., top 1% funds). The model includes three pieces: (i) probability; (ii) return multiple; (iii) scale at which investing can be done. (There's already lots of information online about IRRs; I'm trying to look at these categories from the probabilistic perspective of individual bets).  Do my assumptions look reasonable?

**Venture Capital/Angel.** A *world class* early stage investor can achieve the following return profile up until about a $1M check size. These investors tend to write many checks; most investments essentially go to zero, but a few return an enormous return to make up the difference.

| **Probability** | **Return Multiple** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 5%          | 1000x           |
| 95%         | 0x              |

**Private equity.** A rough model for the best PE shops (we can assume they are generalists moving from bull market to bull market) flipping companies on a 2-5 year horizon:

| **Probability** | **Return Multiple** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 30%         | 10x             |
| 50%         | 5x              |
| 10%         | 1x              |
| 10%         | 0x              |

up to $500M scale.

**Opportunistic hedge funds.** Hedge funds looking for assymetric bets at scale might be modeled as

| **Probability** | **Return Multiple** |
| ----------- | --------------- |
| 15%         | 15x             |
| 75%         | 1x              |
| 10%         | 0x              |

and they can do this reliably up to $10B of scale.

**Expected returns.** Using the above information, we can compile the following expected return profiles:

| **Investing Style** | **Expected Return**    |
| --------------- | ------------------ |
| Venture Capital | 50x @ $1M scale    |
| PE              | 5.6x @ $500M scale |
| Hedge Funds     | 3x @ $10B scale    |

**Question:** Is my model *roughly* correct? Are there egregious mistakes I'm making in my assumptions?"

If the market is down -10% over a calendar year, and the hedge fund is up 15% over the same time frame - is the performance fee assessed on the total outperformance differential of 25%? (15% HF - (-10%) market)

Hedge fund legend Ray Dalio talks about the losses his fund has taken. They had to decide how to respond to the coronavirus situation, and just sat on their hands. No doubt many more mutual and hedge funds are having to make tough re-allocation decisions right now. I know folks here are mostly buy-and-never-sell index investors, but this is an interesting glimpse into the active investment side of things.

edit: I actually don't understand why active funds like his didn't take larger hedging measures against the virus spreading and disrupting economies everywhere. If there's, say, a 30% chance of a 30-50% fall in equities, it would be remiss for active managers not to hedge against that scenario. While hindsight is 20-20, choosing not to take action was really an active bet that the virus wouldn't have significant impact, and I don't see why he or the analyst-managers at his firm made that call."
2020-03-26,std_enable_if,48,"Investing psychology: do people who make more money care less about getting the ""best"" returns?","I realized that when I was a college student, I was pretty obsessed with getting 50-100% returns a year, often taking on big risks to do so. I was trying to time the market, using leveraged ETFs and options, buying and selling VIX products, and buying high risk/high reward stocks.

After graduation, I got myself a pretty decent job, and I've been maxing my 401k into an S&P500 mutual fund regardless of market fluctuations without a care in the world. I'm also buying stocks that I like outside my 401k that I think have great future potential through DCA, without much regard to their price movements. I feel like I'm making so much as a 23 year old compared to my peers, that even if my investments underperform, I'll still be doing relatively well later in life, so returns matter less. Like, for example, if I have 0% returns for the next 40 years, I'll still probably be able to amass 5M by the time I'm 65 assuming I get no raises, which would be 2.3M inflation-adjusted at 2%. In a HYSA, it'd be 5M inflation-adjusted. That's definitely enough, and I have no care about getting more than that. I also don't have a target retirement age - more like if I have enough for 3% SWR and I don't care much about working anymore I'll retire.

I did a little poll with my other high-earning friends, and they share similar opinions, mostly just DCA away, but when we were in college, we would be thinking about shit like XIV, and how to short the VIX spike, etc.

What does r/investing think? Are the market timers mostly people who are earning less and think the stock market is a way to get ahead? I hypothesize that there's a correlation between earning more and taking less risk when investing, and probably why the really rich folks put some money away in hedge funds that return less than the market but with less volatility."
2020-03-05,ryeander,95,WSJ: Thin Liquidity in Stock Futures Raises Risk of More Wild Market Moves,"https://www.wsj.com/articles/thin-liquidity-in-stock-futures-raises-risk-of-more-wild-market-moves-11583365788?mod=mhp


Trading conditions have sharply deteriorated in a popular vehicle for betting on swings in the S&P 500, exacerbating the volatility in the stock market in the past two weeks.

E-mini S&P 500 futures play a huge, if little understood, role in financial markets, with hundreds of billions of dollars of trading activity each day. They track the S&P 500 and typically move in lockstep with the broad-based index.

For reasons that aren’t fully clear, liquidity in the E-mini market has been unusually depressed during the past two years. It eroded to near record lows during the coronavirus-fueled selloff of late February, and it is still thin—a sign of potential turbulence going forward.

For most of 2017, the average number of E-mini contracts available to be bought or sold within a tight band around their current price, corresponding to a one-point move in the S&P 500, hovered between 3,000 and 6,000, Deutsche Bank data show.


But over the past two years, that number has rarely climbed above 2,000 contracts. On Friday, it fell to just 163 contracts—down more than 80% from a week earlier—before slipping even further, to 132 contracts, on Tuesday, according to Deutsche Bank.

The term “liquidity” refers to the ability to execute a big trade without affecting the price of an asset. In layman’s terms, lower liquidity means that when a wave of selling hits a particular market, prices drop more sharply than they would have otherwise. In the case of the E-mini, heavy selling has a knock-on effect on the stock market itself—and on investors’ portfolios.


There are various ways to measure liquidity, and it is a matter of debate which is best. A simple approach is to look at the trading volume of a particular market. By that standard, liquidity in E-minis has never been better, hitting a record on Friday with more than $850 billion traded that day.

But the liquidity metric tracked by Deutsche Bank’s analysts—the number of contracts available to be bought or sold—offers a measure of how fragile a market is. When there are lots of traders posting quotes to buy E-mini contracts, they effectively act as a buffer against sellers putting downward pressure on the S&P 500.

And by that standard, the buffer is now very thin.

“Markets have been walking on thin ice, on and off, for more than a year,” said Shankar Narayanan, head of trading research at Quantitative Brokers, a financial-technology company that provides software for executing futures trades to banks and hedge funds.

Futures are contracts that allow traders to bet on future price moves in many markets, including oil, gold and U.S. Treasury notes. Currently, the most active E-mini contract is tied to the value of the S&P 500 on March 20. But in practice, it moves in tandem with the index’s current value.

Unlike stocks or exchange-traded funds, E-mini futures trade nearly around the clock, five days a week. Traders use them for a variety of strategies, including hedges to protect against market declines.

Kevin Davey, an independent futures trader in Cleveland, was among those who retreated from the market last week because of the vanishing liquidity. Mr. Davey runs a number of trading algorithms in E-minis, some of which shut down or dialed back their activity as measures of liquidity or volatility got too extreme.


“The sheer depth and extremity of the move caught me and a lot of people off guard,” he said. “When things get too squirrelly in terms of movement, sometimes it is best to stay on the sidelines.”

Exchange operator CME Group Inc., which runs the market, says $342 billion worth of E-mini S&P 500 futures changed hands on an average day so far this year. By comparison, average daily trading volume of the entire U.S. stock market has been about $433 billion, according to research firm Tabb Group.

A CME spokeswoman pointed to the futures contract’s strong volume figures as evidence of its health. Last week, “a record number of market participants turned to the E-mini futures market to manage their risk,” she said.

It is unclear why E-mini liquidity has been in retreat. It appears to have never recovered from the shock of Feb. 5, 2018, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 4.6% and the Cboe Volatility Index spiked 116%, blowing up a number of popular volatility-linked trades in an event that some dubbed “volmageddon.”

Some market veterans say E-mini liquidity has deteriorated because of fundamental shifts in the futures world. In recent years, traders at banks and hedge funds have become increasingly likely to buy and sell futures using automated algorithms, which tend to chop up large trades into many smaller ones. That has resulted in smaller orders being placed on futures exchanges, for shorter amounts of time, according to a study released last year by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

Meanwhile, the number of market makers active in futures has dwindled as the industry has consolidated, with a few electronic trading giants such as Citadel Securities, DRW Holdings and Jump Trading expanding as smaller rivals have shut down or been acquired.

Precise numbers on futures market-making aren’t publicly available. But Rick Lane, chief executive of financial-software firm Trading Technologies, estimates that about half a dozen market makers now dominate the business. A decade ago, he said, there were at least 10 times as many market makers.

“That concentration likely has an impact on the volatility and likelihood of swings in the market,” Mr. Lane said."

2020-03-15,creamyhorror,33,"Missing the worst days and missing the best days / ""market timing"" for active investors","So there's a big argument going on about buy-and-hold (never sell) DCA investing versus taking a view on the coronavirus & oil crisis. A lot of it boils down to buy-and-hold being the standard advice given to mainstream investors. There are a few (imo somewhat misleading) articles going around attempting to illustrate why buy-and-hold is better than certain other strategies. **There is absolutely nothing wrong with pure buy-and-hold for passive investors who aren't interested in studying and following the market.**

That said, *active* investors who have a market view on the economic impacts of a shock as severe as the coronavirus are, in my opinion, justified in taking active strategies to avoid periods of volatility and fast drops in the market. As we have often seen, when the market falls, it usually falls fast, and usually takes more time to recover, so it may statistically make sense to exit positions during a serious fall and re-enter after volatility has fallen. (Some traders learned this lesson during the recent crypto crashes.)

To that point, I present this article for discussion:
https://theirrelevantinvestor.com/2019/02/08/miss-the-worst-days-miss-the-best-days/ This article shows that, theoretically, missing **both** the best days and the worst days beats purely buying-and-holding the S&P 500.

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Shops, restaurants and cinemas may be deserted in many parts of virus-plagued China, but online trading forums, internet roadshows and analyst calls are teeming with investors who have driven up stock trading volumes to nine-month highs.


Strategists are busy meeting anxious investors online to dispense tips on how to trade the coronavirus, while fund managers aggressively pitch products via live video streaming, with face-to-face conferences banned and many offices still closed.

The virus has been a blow to China’s already-slowing economy, prompting Beijing to boost financial support to avoid a deeper hit to economic growth. But with many cities still locked down and people staying home amid efforts to contain an epidemic that has killed more than 1,000, online activity is buzzing.

“The government is injecting liquidity to aid the virus-hit economy,” said Shanghai-based hedge fund manager Li Zhen, who has been trading at home since the outbreak began around the start of the Lunar New Year in late January.

“Loose liquidity, plus a rising willingness to trade, help lift trading turnover.”

Investor enthusiasm is highlighting a long-standing disconnect between China’s stock market and its real economy.

While analysts and government researchers forecast a sharp hit to the country's GDP growth this year, Chinese equities have risen for six consecutive sessions as investors piled in to hunt for bargains following the market's .SSEC 8% plummet on Feb. 3, the first trading session after the new year.

The start-up board ChiNext .CNT has recovered all its losses, hitting a more than three-year-high on Monday, while the Shanghai market last week witnessed its biggest weekly trading volume since April, 2019.

“Investors who missed last year’s bull run are taking advantage of the correction to get onto the ride,” said Huang Wei, a former Wall Street trader who has recently set up a trading forum on China’s WeChat messaging platform that offers paid stock recommendation services to retail investors.

“The virus doesn’t change long-term fundamentals of China’s market, just as the Pearl Harbor incident didn’t change U.S. economic strength,” he said, adding Beijing will likely deliver more stimulus, including rate cuts, to cushion the economic fallout from the virus outbreak.

Membership in Huang's newly established trading forum has grown to more than 100 in just a few days as investors are lured into a market that saw the blue-chip CSI300 index .CSI300 jump 36% last year.

That trading enthusiasm has spurred local brokerage Huatai Securities into launching a series of conference calls to help investors pick stocks. Companies to be discussed this week include Anhui Honglu Steel Construction (Group) Co (002541.SZ) and China Railway Group (601390.SS).

Robin Lu, an entrepreneur, said making money through stock investing is more promising than doing business under the current environment.

“The real economy is struggling. But in the stock market, there’s a structural bull,” said Lu, who favors technology stocks. His consultancy business has been affected by the virus, which hit many of his clients.

Meanwhile, mutual fund managers are promoting products for investors who don’t want to pick stocks themselves. More than 30 new funds have been launched over the past week, with several snapped up by investors in just a few days.

China Asset Management Co (ChinaAMC) launched a week-long online roadshow in which 11 fund managers take turns to introduce fund products and share investment views via live video streaming.

“The impact from the virus is short term and won’t affect long-term investment,” ChinaAMC fund manager Zhou Keping told a live forum on Monday, advising investors to buy into tech-focused funds.

The stock market will benefit from “relatively loose liquidity conditions that will improve risk appetite,” he said."

There's a good excerpt in WSJ: https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-making-of-the-worlds-greatest-investor-11572667202

Here's the beginning:

The Making of the World’s Greatest Investor
Jim Simons was a middle-aged mathematician in a strip mall who knew little about finance. He had to overcome his own doubts to turn Wall Street on its head.

by Gregory Zuckerman

Jim Simons sat in a storefront office in a dreary Long Island strip mall. He was next to a women’s clothing boutique, two doors from a pizza joint and across from a tiny, one-story train station. His office had beige wallpaper, a single computer terminal, and spotty phone service.

It was early summer 1978, weeks after Mr. Simons ditched a distinguished mathematics career to try his hand trading currencies. Forty years old, with a slight paunch and long, graying hair, the former professor hungered for serious wealth. But this wry, chain-smoking teacher had never taken a finance class, didn’t know much about trading, and had no clue how to estimate earnings or predict the economy.

For a while, Mr. Simons traded like most everyone else, relying on intuition and old-fashioned research. But the ups and downs left him sick to his stomach. Mr. Simons recruited renowned mathematicians and his results improved, but the partnerships eventually crumbled amid sudden losses and unexpected acrimony. Returns at his hedge fund were so awful he had to halt its trading and employees worried he’d close the business.

Today, Mr. Simons is considered the most successful money maker in the history of modern finance. Since 1988, his flagship Medallion fund has generated average annual returns of 66% before charging hefty investor fees—39% after fees—racking up trading gains of more than $100 billion. No one in the investment world comes close. Warren Buffett, George Soros, Peter Lynch, Steve Cohen, and Ray Dalio all fall short."
2020-02-09,H928,0,I Need to Find Out More About How ETF'S Work,"I understand the basics of ETF's but the more I delve into it the more questions I have.

1. How is an ETF even remotely as safe as people make it out to be when 43% of all ETF's are held by individuals and the rest is locked into hedge funds while more and more people that don't even know what an ETF is or even buys many other investments ""invests"" into it like its a fucking treasury bond. When people pull this out and there is no underlining security net how is that considered safe? In Japan, the gov there owns 50% of ETF's in case of a crash they still hold value and can go back up eventually without failing. The US gov owns 0% and people come to me like this won't ever fail or go down when there are no roadblocks in place to actually make it not fail.
2. How do they pick these stocks when they form an ETF? Where are they coming from and how do these people know that these companies they are picking are safe?

&#x200B;

ETF's sound like a CDO with a few extra steps.

I've talked to Economics teachers, my accountant and all of these people that fucking work in finance can't explain this to me. And when the people that work in finance can't explain it I doubt the people running it are being responsible. Thanks in advanced if someone helps me to understand the nitty gitty details of this or for pointing me in the right direction."
2020-03-19,peianchen1997,0,How are protecting from coronavirus?,"**Market view**

The coronavirus outbreak and related containment measures are likely to cause considerable disruptions to economic activity in the near term. This may push some developed economies towards the brink of a technical recession, notably Japan and the euro area. A still-resilient consumer underpins the U.S. expansion. Yields that are approaching lower bounds make government bonds less effective portfolio ballast, especially outside the U.S.

**Recommendation**

**1.Equities**

1.Defensive and quality equities. Those equities that have stronger relative performance when market volatility are high are defensive and quality equities.

2.Japanese equities benefiting most from an eventual global manufacturing recovery and a lull in trade tensions.

3. EM equities as beneficiaries from the global recovery once the current shock dissipates. EM central banks are likely to stay on their easing paths, supporting growth and equity markets.

4. The best performing industries include food, grocery and healthcare Coronavirus is supporting EBIT and profit of companies in these industries.

**2.Fixed income**

a) Interest rate are lower, default risk is higher, there would be weaker dollar favoring foreign exposure and inflation. I overweight core allocation as we prefer a stable fixed income portfolio (i.e. high quality, safer fixed income investment). In the core allocation, 98% would be long-term fixed income allocation, 65% based on bottom up and 35% using top down investing.

b) Treasury Inflation- Protected Securities: The asset class has rallied amid the coronavirus outbreak, making an entry point less attractive now. I still see potential for higher inflation amid U.S. wage pressures and like TIPS in strategic portfolios.

c) Global high yield: I like global high yield for its income potential. Near-term risks include the coronavirus shock hitting growth and the oil price fall hurting energy issuers.

d)I still like hard-currency EM debt against a backdrop of dovish EM central banks and a stable to weaker U.S. dollar. I prefer the high-yielders. The coronavirus outbreak is a risk to growth.

e) I maintain Asia fixed income as an overweight, with a preference for up-in-quality exposures. Asian central banks have some room to ease policy,

**3. Alternative investment:** The coronavirus isn’t yet contained. Therefore alternative investment represents an excellent opportunity for diversification and return. **Coronavirus is creating larger inefficiencies in the market, nevertheless it also creating opportunities.** For instance hedge funds such Brevan Howard Asset Management  have navigated very well in the market, Other hedge fund also have performed very well during the Coronavirus Outbreak, you can track their performance using Eurekahedge, Funds Portal or HFM Global and select the hedge fund you want to invest. And if you are concerned with a) liquidity problems of hedge funds b)  have not enough money or do not meet their financial requirement to invest in a hedge fund c) want to diversify more, you can invest in **Daedalus investment platform**, which first fully-digital platform in Europe, offering access to alternative investments and carefully designed portfolios of top performing hedge funds.

**4.Gold:** Gold will rise due to lower opportunity cost investing gold driven by current 0 short-term real interest and reducing real returns for creditors, making returns no longer attractive b) Poor performance in risky assets and high market uncertainty c) De-dollarization d) Bullion banks will be forced to steal customers allocated gold. The more negative the nominal and real interest rate environment, the greater backwardation of gold, and the larger the price increases in gold and the quicker the de-dollarization.

**5.Oil:** Opportunities to buy up cheaper stocks in oil and manufacturing could be right around the corner as they begin recovering from the gut-punch of the selloff. Pay attention to stocks like [CLX, +13.27%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/CLX?mod=MW_story_quote) and Moderna Inc. [MRNA, +6.38%](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/MRNA?mod=MW_story_quote),too, as people around the world suddenly begin to prioritize cleanliness and vaccines.

Other reasons to buy oil include: a) World’s demand for oil remains strong and expected to *grow* in the future few years where phase one trade deal between the U.S. and China i*s* improving global demand outlook b) A weaker US dollar during the next recession support prices c) Slowing of U.S. shale oil production growth favoring oil prices in the mid-and *long-term* d) Iran-US escalation is currently *beingdisrupted* the oil market, creating a backwardation in the forward curve. I expect US-Iran war tensions to not relief in near-term, which provides further support for oil prices e) Low oil inventories, deeper outputs cuts by OPEC and its allies, and IMO 2020 regulations will see crude oil prices rise in the forward curve. I expect US-Iran war tensions to not relief in near-term, which provides further support for oil prices f) Expect lower real interest rate in the next recession results in reduced production and increased storage, implying a higher oil price g) Currency devaluation in the next recession support the increase of oil price of both Brent and WTI crude oil h) Quantitative easing will also support oil prices"

This is officially my first post to reddit. Long time reader, I also watch YouTube videos and don’t have an account so please forgive if my posting etiquette is off. Use to be a casual trader have a degree in economics with specialty in behavioral economics and minor in psychology. Also initially left college in my sophomore year (2010) to move to California and start a dispensary. I was going to McGill university in Montreal for those of you who don’t know of it(most Americans). FYI I am American myself and I’m Canada they call Harvard americas McGill (not bragging personally I still believe college is a tax on lower and middle class). I visited a friend on spring break and this is a time when a gram of weed would get you a night in jail and a misdemeanor and if you are lucky enough to live in Texas or Tennessee and be black either 1-10 in jail and at minimum they’d take your car or house or whatever expensive enclosed space you owned in which they found it or probably planted it. I could not believe what I was seeing when I went to see my friend (LA) and ultimately never returned from spring break. These were also the days when the laws in California were changing so fast that if you got a dispensary license in about 6 months you could sell the license for 10-100x what you paid for it (2k -7k if you used a lawyer or 500$ if you did all the paperwork yourself). I ended up starting the first 24hr delivery dispensary (legal) in California at that time probably the world. Needless to say it was very successful, after about a year I hired someone else to run the day to day and mostly became a semi professional gambler which many of you would consider yourselves. The difference is I was actually gambling in casinos. This is not a story in which I stupidly lose all my money at a craps table although there were some fear and loathing-esque weekends during this time that are noteworthy themselves. Also to note I decided to move with exactly 2$ to my name and my parents cutting me off because I was leaving college, luckily I also owned (or rather rented for free) a spot on my dear friends couch (who would later end up being an employee). Within 6 months I was worth about 50k within 12 I was making that much every week. This is the part where some of you may become disappointed because of all the interesting preamble that sounded like it was going to end in a crazy story where I used 50 lbs of weed to leverage a massive short on some stock because I had 24hrs to pay off the Armenian mafia or they would give me a Chinese haircut. Despite the fact that that did happen (with some minor liberties taken in the description although ones that make it actually less crazy of a story) it’s not what I am here writing about. I ended up starting my dispensary by winning 48k one night at the native casino near LA can’t remember the name but anyone from SoCal knows what it’s called. I was also a casual trader albeit very successful when I took it seriously. My dad is also a doctor so I essentially invested it all on ARNA before the fda approval of their new weight loss drug (at the time) I think it was called belviq. Anyway it was a killer, went from like 5 bucks to like 25 in a couple of days and I was looking good to start my business. Since then I’ve continued to dabble and did a lot of shorting but hated the risk, was unaware of options trading. After reading a couple articles online I started getting into it, fast forward to me studying economics (In which I didn’t learn much I didn’t already know except how to use programs to analyze massive amounts of data to find out trends that mostly my own intuition was good enough to tell me),  but now atleast I’m a “respectable person” in the eyes of my parents and the business world. Ultimately since this is my first post I decided to go big and long with it because I just felt that would be proper and maybe someone would be entertained, and maybe in the future I will divulge the actual crazy shit that happened but wall street bets doesn’t seem like the right thread (?). I just wanted to introduce myself and say, when TSLA hit 964 two days ago how many thousands of wallstreeters and tens of thousands of thousands or hundreds or however many of you redditors that are trading options and know half a twats worth what you’re doing did jizz their pants and buy some puts. Personally I like to gamble only saw it once it had dipped down to 900$ before closing but was trending down already. I figured I’d buy something that had a really short execution period for cheap af at like 895$ and once it dipped to like 865 or something sell but ultimately I knew in my heart as most of u do that it was going to drop to maybe 700 or lower. Didn’t have the liquidity to do what I would have liked but called some of the rich people I know who did and they wanted to jerk me off at 11 am the next morning. The few who missed out were begging for what next. One particular who is a relative of mine and a VP at major software company (think top 3) argued that wouldn’t everyone be buying puts and isn’t that what drove the price up? Wouldn’t it be better to sell options on the tsla shares you own and then if it goes down you made some cash and buy more at the lower price. I’m sure many of you know why that is a much weaker play and has way less upside and at the same time limits your risk way less. When the morning came he and others who didn’t follow thru were dying they missed out and asking me what to do next. I hadn’t looked much but it seemed to be bottoming out at 7 and I assumed put buyers were starting to executing their contracts so I said buy calls near 700 and do it for the shortest period u can find in terms of days. By lunch time it’s at 750$ ofcourse and my suggestion of 10-20 contracts would be betting a nice 80-90k maybe more if u bought the ridiculously short term options. Most of them were able to cash out my relative who is an exec at (insert top software company here) still missed out. He had to go into a meeting and didn’t have enough time to execute and wanted to die as he watched the stock jump 50$ and the imaginary dollars that would have been piling up in his investment account disappearing for the second time in one day for the levels he trades and wanted to buy this would have been around 1m maybe he would have made. After his meeting he messages me “uhh I think I need you to manage part of my portfolio, can you do the options trading for me and manage my short term stocks? I don’t have enough time to watch the market because of meetings etc. and when I see what I’m missing out on I can’t pay attentions during the meetings and it’s fucking up my productivity.” - me : “ well I don’t want to have access to your password etc. and be responsible if some fucked shit happens in your portfolio I don’t want to be blamed. Also if I don’t know how I feel about making you millions and then accepting whatever tip you feel is appropriate. Obviously we could do like a percentage but I’d feel better about starting a separate fund and you can put in whatever you feel comfortable investing and we can see how it goes. I Send the same message to everyone in my thread. Looks like I may have inadvertently started a hedge fund let’s see how it goes. Depending on the funding I will repost with proof."

Beneath China’s stable headline numbers, there is a growing belief that the real picture is much worse

By Mike Bird and Lucy Craymer
Sept. 8, 2019 12:29 pm ET

In the second quarter of this year, official Chinese data showed economic growth of 6.2%, close to Beijing’s target and within a percentage point of what it has reported every quarter for the past 4½ years.

A few months earlier, satellites monitoring Chinese industrial hubs suggested parts of the world’s largest trading economy were contracting. An index of Chinese industrial production created by a multinational manufacturer was pointing to lower growth than official figures. And a web-search index used to gauge how many workers return to their jobs after the Lunar New Year holidays was down sharply from a year earlier.

Beneath China’s stable headline economic numbers, there is a growing belief among economists, companies and investors around the world that the real picture is worse than the official data. That has analysts and researchers crunching an array of alternative data—from energy consumption to photos taken from space—for a more accurate reading.

Their conclusion: China’s economy isn’t tanking, but it is almost certainly weaker than advertised. Some economists who have dissected China’s GDP numbers say more accurate figures could be up to 3 percentage points lower, based on their analysis of corporate profits, tax revenue, rail freight, property sales and other measures of activity that they believe are harder for the government to fudge.

China, whose GDP topped $13 trillion last year, is still growing, and the alternative data points to that. It indicates the deceleration is happening in areas such as manufacturing. In many cases, alternative indicators have previewed the path of official data and show the depth of the challenges Chinese authorities face.

“Manufacturing is being hit really hard,” said Leland Miller, chief executive officer of China Beige Book, which measures China’s economic strength based on thousands of survey responses from mainland companies. “Investment is down, hiring took a serious hit, a huge hit to new orders.”

China on Friday released billions of dollars to banks in an effort to revive business sentiment as the U.S.-China trade battle continues. The People’s Bank of China reduced the amount of money commercial banks have to hold in reserve, enabling lenders to finance projects.

Much of the data “is telling us nothing good about the China economy,” said Eric Pratt, head of global marketing at AVX Corp. , a maker of electronic components based in Fountain Inn, S.C., which has two Chinese factories producing parts for cars and mobile phones. Mr. Pratt said over the past year, as alternative indicators and forecasts pointed to more weakness, his company cut some jobs and slowed production.

Over the past decade, China’s growth has made up between a quarter and a third of the world’s economic expansion. The country’s size and interconnectedness around the globe now means small changes in output impact the performance of all major economies, including the U.S. and trade-oriented ones such as Germany and Japan.

Since the escalation of the U.S.-China trade conflict, suspicion that China may be massaging its official data to paint a picture of broad economic health has become a challenge for Washington. U.S. trade negotiators have been seizing on any signs of weakness in their attempt to squeeze more concessions from Beijing.

As the effects of tit-for-tat tariffs filter into China’s economy, the country’s government has also tightened access to data that has proved reliable in the past, in some cases stopping the release of indicators that paint an unfavorable picture.

In December, a manufacturing index for the trade-intensive Guangdong province was suspended after trailing national figures for months. The country’s National Bureau of Statistics said the local government that produced the index didn’t have permission to do it.

China’s official unemployment figures haven't changed much since the trade war began, raising questions about their reliability.

One challenge for businesses and investors is that China’s economy can’t be easily deciphered using measures such as unemployment and real GDP growth because those numbers don’t change much or are carefully managed. Where China’s central bank sets interest rates also isn’t a good gauge of growth, because most large Chinese banks are state-owned entities whose lending is driven by policy goals rather than profit motives.

One official measure of China’s unemployment rate has hovered between 3.5% and 4.5% for the last 15 years, a pattern that has led many economists to conclude it is unreliable. About two years ago, China began publishing an unemployment rate for urban areas derived from a labor survey that authorities said was more accurate. It recently showed a higher reading of 5.3%, but has also moved in a fairly tight range.

Authorities have defended their data. Earlier this year, after China reported stronger-than-expected GDP growth, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics said the state wasn’t ironing out economic fluctuations. In August, another representative of the body said its survey of the country’s labor force was relatively reliable, scientific and accurate.

Generally speaking China’s data has captured some degree of slowdown, though sometimes later than private measures. But government efforts to keep the economy from cratering, such as infrastructure spending, lending and other stimulus, can obscure areas of weakness or smooth headline growth numbers. As a result, they often don’t capture what companies are seeing on the ground, independent economists say.

That has left the door open for dozens of proprietary data providers who are competing for a growing field of financial and multinational clients, global central banks and government agencies around the world. They face a challenging task given China’s vast and diverse economy where labor conditions, incomes and business activity levels vary widely between modern cities, manufacturing hubs and swaths of rural areas.


Companies that sense the economy isn’t doing so well are adjusting their strategies. American apparel company Brooks Brothers Group Inc. is expanding in China, but after detecting weaker retail sentiment in conversations with mall operators and in customer traffic and tourist numbers, the chain is in some cases setting up shop in smaller spaces instead of larger stores.

“There has been some softening,” said Andy Lew, president of Brooks Brothers’ international division.

London-based research firm Capital Economics has its own gauge of Chinese economic growth constructed from measures such as the amount of property floor space under construction, electricity output, freight and passenger traffic, and seaport volumes. “The problem is not a lack of data but more the quality,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard, its Singapore-based senior China economist.

The firm’s index, called the China Activity Proxy, has shown growth below official figures for the past seven years. It recently indicated an expansion rate of around 5.7% due in part to stronger construction activity. But electricity production—a proxy for heavy industry—has slumped and credit growth remains weak, supporting the idea that parts of the economy aren’t doing well.


In July, China reported 4.8% year-over-year growth in industrial output, its slowest pace in 17 years. A large multinational company had seen the signs much earlier.

Eaton Corp. , a global manufacturer of electrical components and power systems for buildings, industrial facilities, planes and other machinery, has about $2 billion sales in China. Last year, its in-house index showed 2.7% industrial production growth while China’s official reading was above 5% over the course of 2018. The company’s index estimated 2.5% growth for the first half of 2019.

The index was constructed by a team of in-house economists about a decade ago, when Eaton noticed demand in its markets was weaker than Beijing’s growth numbers, said its former chief economist Jim Meil. The index was built from Chinese data combed from domestic sources that included automotive sales, steel production and construction activity, Mr. Meil said.


SpaceKnow tracks about 6,000 industrial locations in China and analyzes data on night-light luminosity and infrared bands—indicators of heat produced by electricity or factories—from about half those sites roughly every two weeks. It produces a proprietary index that has become a leading Chinese PMI indicator used by hedge funds, central banks and policy makers, said CEO Jeremy Fand.

“You can see factories suddenly go quiet, giant subdivisions, huge construction projects just get halted,” said Mr. Fand. In August, SpaceKnow’s index pointed to a slight expansion, coming close to official figures that analysts said reflected a pickup in production before more U.S. tariffs came into effect.

Mr. Fand said the company is also working on a project for a U.S. government agency that is trying to analyze the impact of U.S. tariffs on China’s economy and certain industries.

Last December, U.S. exchange operator Nasdaq Inc. bought an alternative-data business called Quandl Inc. Bill Dague, a data scientist leading alternative research at Quandl, has traveled to China in recent months to hunt for new data sets for clients.

“Because it is so hard to get data out of China, demand has surpassed supply,” he said, adding that escalating U.S.-China tensions have made domestic data vendors less willing to share information with U.S. companies.

Quandl’s data includes satellite images of aluminum stockpiles and containers of concentrate sitting outside Chinese smelters and storage facilities before and after the U.S. imposed 10% tariffs on Chinese aluminum in March 2018.


Before the duties took effect, geospatial images indicated factories were ramping up aluminum production. By the summer of that year, the stockpiles had run down and the production supplies weren’t replenished at many smelters, indicating slower production and slackening demand weeks before it was reflected in Chinese government data.

George Mussalli, who oversees research and investments at Boston-based PanAgora Asset Management Inc., said one metric he monitors yearly is a “Spring Festival Index” produced by Chinese web-search giant Baidu Inc. PanAgora is a quantitative investment fund that uses data, mathematical and computer models to develop trading strategies.

Baidu’s index is compiled from the number of people who use its search engine to find information about travel and transportation options around the weeklong festival, which coincides with Lunar New Year. During that period, millions of workers embark on long commutes from big industrial cities to rural areas in central China to spend the holiday with their families.


One index showed a drop in the number of people searching about travel for a weeklong spring festival this year.

This year’s festival took place in early February, and the index showed a 12% drop in the number of people searching about travel in contrast to the previous year. Mr. Mussalli said the lower reading was a sign of slower economic activity.

“In years where factories expect less production, some of the workers go home and stay home,” Mr. Mussalli said.

China’s automotive sector, which makes up about a 10th of GDP, has been in a slump since late 2018. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the organization that puts out official sales numbers and forecasts, had earlier estimated that 2019 sales would be flat year on year. In the first seven months of the year, they fell 12.8%. Despite that, the official forecast is now for a 5.4% full-year decline.

Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch are less optimistic. They forecast a 3.6% drop in car sales at the start of 2019 and now expect a 12% drop for the year.

Ming Hsun Lee, a Hong Kong-based autos analyst at the bank, has been using data from a domestic vendor that collects weekly numbers from companies on production levels, sales to dealers and retail car sales. He said he uses it to calculate inventory levels at manufacturers, and considers price discounts, government stimulus and other factors in developing his forecast.

Mr. Pratt at AVX, the U.S. electronics component maker, said the company has been using the bank’s data to help gauge demand and adjust production. “We don’t use what the government says because they are always really protective of their automotive industry,” he said."

The system makes one trade a month, 1.86 Sharpe, 3.84 Sortino, and has a 32% CAGR (nearly tax free too), with a 12% max draw down in December 2018 in a 10 year period. I am convinced it is among the best portfolio's on Earth. I know that it is extremely profitable, low volatility and think it would be of EXTREME interest to any hedge fund. I backtested this strategy for two years, doing hundreds of tests in excel, testing in Great Depression like scenarios etc. How do you approach a hedge fund with this? What would be the path to convincing a company like Vanguard to develop an ETF based on this strategy? How do you approach a company without giving away your entire method?"
2020-01-01,KDE_Fan,4,Insider trading - what are some things that would be considered insider trading (or maybe some other similar charge)?,"So let's say that a company has their final fiscal quarter of the year coming up and all the employees are under inordinate levels of stress to make sure the company meets their projected goals (which was for growth of 5-6% for the last quarter alone which was originally conservative and is/was possible because one of their major competitors had failed and was going through bankruptcy reorganization (and may eventually be squired by this company for pennies on the dollar).

Now the guy who was upper management, not quite C level position but was something like a senior VP.  Now This guy was so nervous because he's in financial trouble, spread REALLY thin, borrowing Peter to pay Paul until/unless they hit this projected goals.  The guy may have to pull his daughter from private school and there's no way they were going to be able to buy the new car they had pre-ordered 1 year ago ($160,000 car) if the numbers fell short. On top of this he had been missing some mortgage payments to keep paying for his daughters outrageously expensive school, and was now nearing 3 months behind on a $4.5 million house ($29K / month mortgage payment) and the yearly vacation looks like just trips to the country club (if they aren't booted for paying dues late) - he was over 8 months late, but was a chairman & a 25 year member but owed a lot in back dues).

So let's say my wife knows all of this situation because she plays tennis & goes to gym with the VP's wife, so she has the whole scoop.  The social circle within the community is pretty small and there was a lot of talk wondering what was going to happen to ""Joe"" at the end of the year/quarter - many thought he'd move out in disgrace and have to downsize everything until he was making his normal salary again. The reason there is so much pressure, is that Joe receives a tiered bonus package and gets nothing if they don't hit the numbers and only his meager salary (yes it is very meager for a senior VP, but he bonuses are highest in industries next to Hedge fund managers & defense contractors.   So at a bare minimum he's looking at clearing $1.5 mil if they hit projections and it wouldn't be too difficult to see him hitting $10-18 million (he does work 60-90+ hours a week at times and travels globally just about every week).  

So, on Oct 25, Joe make a huge payment on the house (basically back payment + 1 year), paid the country club dues and bought them a new court sweeper (automated) for the tennis courts ($45,000) as a thank you for being understanding  & patient.  He paid his daughters tuition & set aside enough for her next 5 years if she decides to get her masters (a sizeable sum at \~$60k/year for tuition/board) and paid off the new car, ordered a smaller version for his daughter and bought himself a new top of the line Porsche (near $300K or more) as the other car was for the wife.  Finally he arraigned for an extended vacation over winter break/Christmas on a mega yacht for 20 people (daughters, 2 friends each, other family, & friends) followed by skiing at a private lodge in the Alps Switzerland for new years & the following week.    The total amount wsa probably at least to $3.5 and Joe isn't even a big spender, he usually invests a large portion into a family trust b/c of the way his bonuses are structured (cap gains and such).

So now there's a number of people who know of Joe's recent purchases and it was common knowledge that his company was waiting to see if they won the bid for a massive contract which was going to make or break the projected earnings and if they landed it, he was looking at growth rates much higher than those projected - thus greatly increasing his bonus & stock options.  So this spending seemed to indicate the company was going to well excede the projected growth/earnings by maybe 2-3x the original 5-6% and word got out in the community (and country club) that things were looking good for Joe's company.  Joe has said absolutely nothing to anyone regarding the outlook but his mood has completely changed from stressed and anxious to joyous. 

So many people in the community had the idea to invest heavily in the company and once the year end report was issued the stock prices soared the first day and continued to increase for the next 2-3 weeks when news of just how bad the competitor's (in bankruptcy) financial situation really was - thus basically eliminating 1 of 4 major players in the industry, and not positioned Joes company at the top and is looking to squire the indebted company for cash & stock - and it would give Joe's company MANY patents that work synergistically wish Joe's company.  So over about 5 weeks, Joe's company stock doubled and his bonus & stocks was much larger than ever expected - AND many people in his community earned hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars each (over doubled their investment) - and there were well over 40 people who invested a before the end of the year.  

So what I'm wondering is if what these ""friends"" in Joes circle have committed a crime in any way by using the information they knew about his last minute large ticket purchases (very out of character, as I said he was frugal) to predict if the company was going to meet their projections.  

I'm also wondering if the wife has any liability in this for talking about their financial problems, which was then spread by gossip, She nor Joe ever  suggested people invest b/c ""things were looking really good!""

So, if there is no criminal liability for ""insider trading"" or something similar, I'm wondering if the situation were reversed, Joe was in same financial situation/debt, and then pulled his daughter out of school, canceled order for new car, put in notice at country club they were not renewing and looked into refinancing the mortgage among many other cost saving things.  

Now if the community/(joe's circle) saw all of this, they could deduce that the company wasn't going to hit the projections, another company was going to win the important bid/contract and that company would probably end up squiring the bankrupted company - and Joe's company would be in very rough waters near rocky shores from then on. 

So I'm guessing people could short the stock and or buy put options (can you do both to make even more money by guessing how much the stock will fall?).  

So the question again, is this type of action illegal due to the information they have about Joe's personal spending/finances? Also, all the information about Joe's company & the bid/contract are public knowledge as well as the info about the company in bankruptcy (along with the patents this company holds)."
2020-01-12,JustAChillDude057,0,How do you view who owns shares in a company?,"I apologize if this is a dumb question, but I can't find any information online about this. I have seen this partially covered on the Nasdaq website and CNNMoney with institutional holdings, but I am curious if there is anywhere (preferably on the SEC website) to view who owns what percentage of a company down to the last percent. For example, I have heard Elon Musk himself owns 22% of Tesla stock from an article, but have no actual information to back this up. This would be even better if I could see what kind of shares are owned. Mutual/Hedge funds having over 50% of a company means more or a lot more if they have voting rights. I am doing this for a presentation for school but also for my own learning.

Also the best ways to follow hedge/mutual funds would be nice. I found this website  ([https://whalewisdom.com/](https://whalewisdom.com/)) which so far appears considerably helpful, but again, I just wanna be able to easily collect this from the SEC website (Although I also heard of a website that gives email notifications to help keep track of stuff). For my presentation, a list of all or the majority of the types of filings mutual/hedge funds have to do would be priceless. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!"
2019-12-31,xesus2019,0,Change My Mind: 2018 and 2019 were rotten years for investing,"Well, what a slog.

I recall January 2018 the S&P making crazy gains, up to 2929.   Then
Trump/trade war.  Now ending 2019 at 3220.

Using my dumb back-of-the-envelope calculations, 3220 - 2929 = 291 and
2929 / 291 is about ten percent over two years, or five percent per
year.  Subtract 1.25 in advisor fees and 1.09 in ""expense ratio"" for
hedge fund managers, factor in that bonds and international probably
did even worse, and maybe the money grows at 2 percent.

Sad, that money doesn't actually grow on trees.  But this is the

2020-01-29,nooeh,0,Les Wexner considering selling Victoria's Secret,"Who do you think are potential buyers? Can the brand be turned around?

https://www.wsj.com/articles/victorias-secret-billionaire-in-talks-to-step-aside-and-sell-brand-11580299200

""Leslie Wexner, the billionaire behind Victoria’s Secret, is in discussions to step aside as chief executive officer of his retail empire and is exploring strategic alternatives for the lingerie brand, according to people familiar with the matter.

The discussions are ongoing and could result in a full or partial sale of Victoria’s Secret, some of the people said. The chain, with about $7 billion in annual sales, has long dominated the U.S. lingerie market but has struggled in recent years with falling sales. The company is looking to reach a decision on the potential deal and succession plans in coming weeks, they said, though there is no guarantee it will reach an agreement.

Mr. Wexner, 82 years old, who built Abercrombie & Fitch, The Limited and Victoria’s Secret into national chains, is the longest-serving CEO of an S&P 500 company. He would be handing over the job after a difficult stretch for the business he has run for 57 years. He could continue in his role as chairman, one of the people said.

[L-brands performance vs S&P 500](https://i.imgur.com/pTYW23Q.png)

Shares of Victoria’s Secret parent company L Brands Inc. dropped 29% last year, missing out on a broad stock market rally. The company, which also owns the Bath & Body Works and Pink chains, has a market value below $6 billion, down from $29 billion at its peak in 2015.

Last year, the New York activist hedge fund Barington Capital Group LP built a small stake in L Brands and urged the company to consider splitting the fast-growing Bath & Body Works chain from Victoria’s Secret. L Brands added two new directors and signed an agreement with Barington to have the fund serve as a special adviser.

Mr. Wexner has run the business since 1963 and took it public in 1969. From a small store in Columbus, Ohio, he built a retail empire by upending the department store model and developing specialty mall brands. He is the company’s biggest shareholder, with a roughly 17% stake, according to the latest proxy filing.

Last year the reclusive Ohio billionaire drew attention for his association with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who for nearly two decades managed Mr. Wexner’s wealth. Mr. Epstein was indicted last summer on federal sex-trafficking charges stemming from an alleged scheme to exploit underage girls. Mr. Epstein died in August while in a New York City prison awaiting trial.

Mr. Epstein supervised Mr. Wexner’s personal investments, bought one of the company’s jets and took a role in the retail business, sometimes trying to offer input on which women should be Victoria’s Secret models, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Mr. Wexner has said that he didn’t know about Mr. Epstein’s alleged criminal behavior and that he ended their relationship more than 10 years ago.

A few days before Mr. Epstein’s death, Mr. Wexner sent a letter to members of his Wexner Foundation accusing Mr. Epstein of misappropriating large sums of his wealth. “I know now that my trust in him was grossly misplaced, and I deeply regret having ever crossed his path,” he wrote in the letter.

The reports of ties between Mr. Epstein and L Brands prompted the company to re-examine Mr. Epstein’s involvement. L Brands’ board hired an outside law firm in July 2019 to investigate what role he played at the company. The results of the investigation haven’t been made public.

Over the years, Mr. Wexner sold off many of the clothing brands he helped create, but held on to his bra-and-beauty businesses, including Victoria’s Secret.

In the mid-1990s, the brand’s heavily padded Miracle Bra, designed to create cleavage, was vying for market share with Sara Lee Corp.’s Wonderbra. Victoria’s Secret doubled down on ads with provocative TV commercials and theatrical fashion shows. In 2004, it launched Pink, a brand aimed at teens and preteens.

In 2016, Mr. Wexner parted ways with the CEO of Victoria’s Secret and assumed direct control of the business. The company warned sales would drop as Mr. Wexner made changes. He eliminated swimwear and shifted away from catalog mailings, but kept hundreds of stores in malls.

As retail bankruptcies were piling up in 2017, he defended his strategy in an interview with the Journal. People crave social interaction and will seek it at places like malls, he said. “I’ve got 5,000 years of history on my side,” pointing to the ancient shopping bazaars in Rome and Istanbul.

Demand for Victoria’s Secret bras continued to cool as customers turned to brands emphasizing comfort and inclusivity. In 2018, Mr. Wexner reversed some of his earlier decisions—re-entering swimwear and mailing out catalogs again.

Last year the company eliminated its televised fashion show and replaced its longtime marketing chief, Edward Razek, who had been instrumental in pushing its overtly sexy marketing. Comparable sales of Victoria’s Secret fell 12% during the holiday period, extending their slide."""
2019-09-20,idreamofkitty,258,Dying Words of T Boone Pickens,"Thomas Boone Pickens Jr. (May 22, 1928 – September 11, 2019) was an American business magnate and financier. Pickens chaired the hedge fund BP Capital Management. He was a well-known takeover operator and corporate raider during the 1980s. As of November 2016, Pickens had a net worth of $500 million.

Before his death, Pickens wrote his last words to be published on LinkedIn by his foundation after he passed.

The entire post is much longer, but below is the key excerpt. In it, Pickens lists his secrets to success and building wealth:

– A good work ethic is critical.

– Don’t think competition is bad, but play by the rules. I loved to compete and win. I never wanted the other guy to do badly; I just wanted to do a little better than he did.

– Learn to analyze well. Assess the risks and the prospective rewards, and keep it simple.

– Be willing to make decisions. That’s the most important quality in a good leader: Avoid the “Ready-aim-aim-aim-aim” syndrome. You have to be willing to fire.

– Learn from mistakes. That’s not just a cliché. I sure made my share. Remember the doors that smashed your fingers the first time and be more careful the next trip through.

– Be humble. I always believed the higher a monkey climbs in the tree, the more people below can see his ass. You don’t have to be that monkey.

– Don’t look to government to solve problems — the strength of this country is in its people.

– Stay fit. You don’t want to get old and feel bad. You’ll also get a lot more accomplished and feel better about yourself if you stay fit. I didn’t make it to 91 by neglecting my health.

– Embrace change. Although older people are generally threatened by change, young people loved me because I embraced change rather than running from it. Change creates opportunity.

– Have faith, both in spiritual matters and in humanity, and in yourself. That faith will see you through the dark times we all navigate.

Anyway, my uncle who owns a hedge fund wants me to sell all I have (I have about 110-120 K depending on the day) in my portfolio, and put it in the SP500 and BRK.B.

**Would I be paying taxes on the liquidation of the account if my sell price is less than the purchase price?**

Additionally, I dont know why he held onto some stocks (dad isn't stupid), is there a way to look at market trends and try to figure out why he was holding onto certain stocks (MNK for example?)

2019-08-23,grittygatorr,151,Serious: What does a quant trader/statistician/mathematician exactly do while trading?,"(Posted earlier on [r/algotrading](https://www.reddit.com/r/algotrading/))

Hey Traders!

The question pretty much sums it all. I am a semi-professional futures trader (CL, ZT, ZS, some crypto), who uses basic technical indicators since two years and has been fairly profitable.

That said, I don't understand the rush towards all things maths and statistics as a basic requirement to trade - if hedge fund and prop trading positions are considered.

So here's my humble question - where exactly does complex math, statistical model making, and computer programming come into the picture? Software dev positions are explanatory, but where do the aforementioned help? Doesn't the first rule of markets say you can't predict prices and movements?

Or is everyone rushing towards complex solutions which could have been solved fairly easily?

Worse still - are talks of ML, RL, AI, algo, etc a ""gimmick"" to attract investor capital?

All thoughts would be very, very helpful.

PS - Don't make this a discussion about TA vs Quant. I do use indicators to trade, but definitely, don't draw discretionary trend lines or watch ""heads and shoulders"" or analyze moon phases to place trades. In fact, I do think TA is complete bull, but using indicators has its logical reasons.

**Edit 1** \- Terrific answers, y'all. I am sure many others would be pleased over these insights.

**Edit 2** \- Here's an outline about how I trade. Mentioned it in one of the comments below but I guess it makes a good add-on to the passage:

As an economics graduate, I understand the most widely used macro-economic models and can construct most models used by mutual funds or I-banks. However, the use of ""complex"" math and Ph.D. degrees as a prerequisite to trade profitably goes right above me.

For example - while trading the soybean oil futures (ZL) market, I look at any directly affecting news variables or major import/export law changes or drastic macro climate changes that would impact ZL prices. I then form a hypothesis of which side (long/short) to take *more* exposure in, check basic moving averages, check soybean futures (they kinda *lead oil* prices indicator-wise) and depending on my screen availability, either trade aggressively or place a couple of contracts and walk away. Each contract costs me $490, each hundredth of a tick movement is worth $6, so a brief move nets me $300-$500 if I trade 6-7 contracts. Some days the market goes crazy and it equates to over a thousand dollars in profits, and it almost never does crazy reversals that I end up taking on a huge loss. For futures like NQ that are absolute beasts in terms of volatility and movement, a few contracts can easily net a few grand if the market goes ballistic (trump tweets, trade war updates, etc).

I guess my point is, this basic idea of how I trade gives me respectable profits - leaving me pondering for the need for a math or physics Ph.D. to trade markets profitably. However, generally knowing what they do greatly helps me appreciate the quant trading sector, and leaves a good impression of how I must not get comfortable with my strategy and look towards including more advanced concepts to ensure I don't end up crying my way to the morgue."
2019-11-19,MasterCookSwag,24,Matt Levine offers some really interesting commentary on borderline fraudulent letters submitted to the SEC regarding the recent corporate proxy changes.,"If you're not subscribed you can get these straight to your inbox daily by going to Matt Levine's bloomberg page.  It's a pretty solid daily read on financial happenings/occasional fuckery and what not.  This one in particular I thought Y'all might enjoy given the recent buzz over proxy advisor changes.  It comes via email so I'll paste below but this should also be on Levine's daily articles on bloomberg. 

**Don’t read the comments**

Most debates over financial regulation are, in an obvious first-order sense, about whether regulation should favor one group of rich powerful financial professionals, or another group. Corporate governance disputes, for instance, basically come down to whether corporate chief executive officers should have more control of their companies, or whether instead more control should go to hedge fund managers and the executives of big asset management companies. This is a problem because regulators can’t really make rules on this basis. They can’t be like “we’ve heard that some CEOs’ feelings are hurt when hedge fund managers criticize their multimillion-dollar paychecks, so we’re changing the rules to be nicer to the CEOs.”


They don’t have to, though, because this is only true in an obvious first-order sense. In fact the CEOs and the hedge fund managers are just representatives of broader groups and more important principles. The hedge fund managers will tell you that they invest the pension money of ordinary people, and that anyway they are advocating for more power for ordinary investors. The CEOs will tell you that they just want to be able to make long-term decisions for the good of their companies in a way that will preserve ordinary people’s jobs and savings. And then if the regulators make a rule favoring the CEOs they can talk about the ordinary workers they’re protecting, and if they make a rule favoring the hedge fund managers they can talk about the ordinary investors they’re protecting, and it is all much more palatable than if you just talk about the CEOs and the hedge fund managers, and also it is basically true. It’s not like the CEOs and the hedge fund managers are fighting each other in a closed ecosystem; the balance of power between them does matter, in an indirect but real way, for everyone else.


It can all feel pretty abstract, though. It’s all well and good to say that you’re representing ordinary people, but it’s better to show it. Ideally what you want is for some ordinary people to write letters to the regulators saying “actually you should favor corporate CEOs over hedge fund managers because of my retirement savings,” or whatever. It can be hard to find ordinary people who actually think that, though, or who have paid enough attention to the issue to write those letters; it feels pretty abstract to them too!


So the next-best choice is to imagine what ordinary people would say if they actually supported your side, and then write that down. Write an imaginary letter on behalf of an imaginary ordinary person, urging the regulator to take the side that favors CEOs or hedge fund managers, whichever side you’re on.
And then once you’ve written that letter just find a real ordinary person and ask her to sign it, whatever, who cares, it’s just a letter, who is going to check.


Bloomberg’s Zachary Mider and Ben Elgin checked:

>When Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton handed a policy win to corporate executives this month, he pointed to a surprising source of support: a mailbag full of encouragement from ordinary Americans.
>To hear Clayton tell it, these folks are really focused on the intricacies of the corporate shareholder-voting process. “Some of the letters that struck me the most,” he said at a commission meeting in Washington, “came from long-term Main Street investors, including an Army veteran and a Marine veteran, a police officer, a retired teacher, a public servant, a single mom, a couple of retirees who saved for retirement.” Each bolstered Clayton’s case for limiting the power of dissenting shareholders.
But a close look at the seven letters Clayton highlighted, and about two dozen others submitted to the SEC by supposedly regular people, shows they are the product of a misleading -- and laughably clumsy -- public relations campaign by corporate interests.
That retired teacher? Pauline Yee said she never wrote a letter, although the signature was hers. … “I never wrote a letter,” said one of the retirees, Vytautas Alksninis, reached by phone at his home in Connecticut. “What’s this all about?”
>Then there’s the public servant Clayton mentioned. … She said the letter originated with a public-affairs firm that contacted her out of the blue.
“They wrote it, and I allowed them to use my name after I read it,” she said. “I didn’t go digging into all of this.”

What is particularly bad here is that “at least 20” of the fake letters contain “an out-of-context phrase inserted into the SEC’s mailing address”: If you’re writing a letter to the SEC, you put the SEC’s address at the top just for old time’s sake (of course you don’t mail it, you just submit it online), and for some reason the person mass-writing these letters inserted the phrase “A Coalition of Growth Companies” into the address that he or she cut and pasted into all the fake letters. Oops!
The specific debate here is about the regulation of proxy advisers; we have talked about it a couple of times before. Basically there are companies called proxy advisers that tell investment managers how to vote on corporate matters, and sometimes they tell the investment managers to vote against corporate management, and the managers don’t like that so they’ve asked the SEC to regulate the advisers more. They can’t just come out and say that, so instead the argument is that the proxy advisers, and the big investment funds who rely on them, might have political and social and governance and power agendas that conflict with the interests of the individual humans whose retirement savings are invested in those funds—that people’s savings are “being steered by third parties to promote individual agendas, rather than to further their primary goals of being able to have enough money,” as Clayton said in the next sentence of his statement.


You can just say that, and people do, and it has a certain truth to it; there are real conflicts between the interests of investment managers (and proxy advisers) and those of their ultimate investors. But it’s better if you can find an 83-year-old Army veteran to say “how disgusted I am that my financial investments are being used as a political pawn,” or a retired Marine veteran” to say “I didn’t invest my money to have others make any kind of political statement. I invested my money to be able to leave something for my children and grandchildren in order to make their lives a little better,” or a hard-working single mother to say “Let the folks who work at proxy advisory firms bring about social change on their dime, not mine,” or a retiree to say “Call me naïve but I certainly didn’t sign up for groups with their own agenda voting my proxy!”


Obviously you can’t find people to say that, because no normal human actually pays attention to or cares about any of this. But if you work on one side of the issue, you can convince yourself that normal people should care about it, and then you can imagine what they might say if they did care, and then you can write it down, and then as a final, only-somewhat-fraudulent step, you can go find an ordinary person to sign the letter you wrote. Perhaps you can even give them a brief summary of the issue, and let them read the letter they’re signing, and get them to care about it enough to agree with you for five minutes before they forget all about it.


The thing is the letters are fine! Whoever wrote them mostly did a good job of imagining how an SEC chairman, or a financial columnist for that matter, would imagine how an 83-year-old Army veteran would think about proxy advisers if he bothered to think about proxy advisers. As works of fiction they have a certain verisimilitude.


Of course it is gross to find out that they are fictional, and that the SEC is citing the support of “Main Street investors” who do not actually support the regulation, but you should not kid yourself that it matters. The SEC isn’t changing the rules because it believes that that’s what Main Street investors want; it’s changing the rules because it believes that that’s what Main Street investors would want, if they paid attention to any of this. The SEC, and the people actually writing the letters, agree that this change is in the interests of ordinary investors and is the sort of thing that ordinary investors would want. It just feels more concrete if they can point to a ordinary investor who does want it.
The obvious solution here is to explicitly allow fictional comment letters. Of course the SEC already allows fictional comment letters, in the sense that it doesn’t seem to do any identity checking, and we have talked before about how lots of comment letters are blatantly fictitious. Many fictitious comment letters seem to be submitted for the sake of numbers: It is nice to say “a hundred ordinary investors wrote in to support this,” or whatever, but that’s rarely true and should not be taken seriously. But other fictitious letters are like these letters; they are submitted for the sake of their argument, and for a certain ordinary-investor flavor that comes from a talented writer of fiction trying to channel what he thinks an ordinary investor would actually feel and say. Why not let those fiction writers practice openly? Why not submit a letter from like the Coalition of Giant Company CEOs saying “as CEOs, we like this rule, but we also think it’s in the interests of ordinary investors, and to give you a sense of that here’s what we imagine an 83-year-old Army veteran might hypothetically have to say about it.” And then you write the fake letter, and the SEC can say “we too can easily imagine that an elderly veteran might say ‘how disgusted I am that my financial investments are being used as a political pawn,’” etc. etc. etc., it loses almost none of its rhetorical effect for being fake. Just admit that it’s all fake!

2019-09-07,ExtremeEducation,0,Index Bubble?,"I just read this article about Michael Burry, warning that Index ETFs are a bubble:

I'm a big believer in index funds as the strategy is so simple and it enables me to leapfrog and protect myself from all kind of shady financial products.

Buffett got me on the index train. He openly recommended to buy indexes and the logic is simple: Basically any other investment will underperform the S&P 500 over time, e.g. WallSteet funds are charging exorbitant fees to manage money plus they underperform the index. He made the famous bet that the S&P will outperform hedge funds and he won. So why would anybody buy mutual funds or try to pick stocks if he will underperform anyway?

I absolutely see Michael Burry's point. So many people are on the index train, they just buy it with complete disregard of the underlying asset value.

And I can see how this could lead to a bubble.

- **Non-liquid. No easy way to jump in and out.** You have to pay either with high spread (let's say at least ~3%) or with time (couple of weeks at lest). This friction should more or less rule out money from individual, speculator hedge funds and government institutions like pension funds etc.
- **Non-marginal. No way to buy it with cheap loan** from the bank. This should rule out cheap credit. 
- **Requires effort or rare knowledge** to evaluate the asset and/or trade it.

Assets that are immediately ruled out: 
- shares, bonds and commodities traded on biggest exchanges.
- conventional real estate like houses (people can buy it with cheap loan).
- commodities traded on biggest exchanges.

Possible candidates:
- shares of small companies in small countries that's not available on big exchanges. Like shares of small farm or hotel businesses in let's say Slovenia. (requires effort to access local exchange and knowledge of local businesses to access asset price)
- put/call options on small companies far away in the future and from the strike price. (high spread, low volume thus may require long time to transact). I know that's could be not the best way to invest, but I'm trying to build the list for now and judge it later.

2019-11-17,hugebiggiant,0,Racial bias in Investing? Just look at the data.,"“But I’m not a racist” 

is a constant refrain in Silicon Valley — a place where 91% of venture capitalists are men, 98% are white or Asian, and almost 90% of their funding goes to white-male led ventures.

It seems like if you buy the pint of vanilla ice cream over the chocolate pint 98 out of 100 times you walk into the grocery store, you might have some ingrained preference for vanilla, no? Maybe you think you have open taste buds, but if vanilla is on the front of the shelf, and it’s a brand you recognize, it’s just the easiest thing to pick up and move on with your day. You’re not looking to see if something else might be available, and equally or more delicious, hiding in plain sight. You’re moving on autopilot, and thus eating a lot of vanilla, whether or not it’s good for you. And that’s what’s most tragic about the status quo – it not only hurts those who aren’t getting chosen, but also the person doing the choosing. 

Venture capitalists, and the asset owners and managers who fund them, pride themselves on being open-minded when it comes to allocating capital: “I don’t care if they are black, blue or have purple spots, as long as they are great managers who can make money.” They view themselves as fully available to new flavors, spotting trends before others do in order to capture the best returns in a competitive market. 

But they are forgetting about the notion of unconscious bias, the ingrained habits we get from society that are extra difficult to root out. Like breathing while sleeping, they happen so naturally we don’t even acknowledge their existence. We only see the outcome — that we don’t die in our sleep (if we are lucky), and we wind up with portfolios of predominantly white fund managers and entrepreneurs. 

This not only means that we as capital allocators perpetuate the vast racial and socioeconomic inequality of our society, but also that we are missing out on massive sources of innovation in a majority-minority country. These two reasons are why at Candide Group, we’ve put such an emphasis on diversity within our portfolio, with over half of funds and companies we support led by women and people of color (and in some cases, but not enough of them, by women of color, and trans and queer founders). 

It’s also why we’ve supported Illumen Capital: a new fund of funds that is specifically looking to help fund managers build stronger practices around diversity and root out unconscious bias.

Illumen was founded by Daryn Dodson, an African-American investor and fierce advocate for social equity. While — let’s face it — inequities in capital allocation are largely caused by white people like me, we are lucky that Dodson is lending his time and talent to help remedy the problem and demonstrate the true implicit benefit of diversity in VC.

Illumen recognizes this is a multi-year process, and just like any habit we wish to change, we have to essentially go through the equivalent of a 10 step program — admit we have a problem, that we are not always in control (as our unconscious biases take over), and then find new tools and strategies to change our behaviors moving forward. 

The first step toward admitting one has a problem? Data. Illumen has partnered with Stanford University’s “do tank” SPARQ (Social Psychological Answers to Real-World Questions) to do one of the first comprehensive, blind studies to better examine both how unconscious bias shows up, and what its impacts are. I sat down with Dodson, Dr. Ashby Monk (member of the SPARQ team and executive director of the Global Projects Center at Stanford), Dr. Hazel Markus, (co-director of SPARQ), Dr. Sarah Lyons-Padilla (a research scientist at SPARQ and leading author of the study), and Jason Henning (Senior Vice President of Investor Relations) to learn more about this report, and what investors might want to do differently as a result.

So let’s cut to the chase. What did this study show?

Dodson: The study had three key findings: 

Asset allocators have trouble gauging the competence of racially diverse teams. Asset allocators’ judgments of the team’s competence were more strongly correlated with predictions about future performance (e.g., money raised) for racially homogenous teams than for racially diverse teams.
Racially diverse teams face bias at the top. At stronger performance levels, asset allocators rated white-led funds more favorably than they did black-led funds when evaluating investment skills, competence, and social fit.
Racially diverse teams get the benefit of the doubt at the bottom, but not more funding. At weaker performance levels, asset allocators actually rated black-led teams more favorably than white-led teams in terms of overall performance, investment skills, and ability to raise money. However, asset allocators expressed little interest in investing in weaker funds, diverse or otherwise. 
Dr. Monk: The influence that these beneficial institutional investors — who control nearly $100 trillion in assets — ave on the entire chain of financial intermediation, capitalism and even society cannot be overstated. It is of the highest importance that they invest and operate without bias. This paper and its findings hopefully raise awareness of the types of biases that remain. Racial bias is still alive and well in our country and its system of capitalism, and the investment community needs to do more to counter it in order to live up to their fiduciary obligations.

Dr. Markus: This careful analysis of the judgements of actual asset allocators reveals that the same types of biases that social psychologists have long documented in many arenas of society — education, employment, and everyday social life — are also at work in the powerful financial services industry. Rather than an emphasis on “fixing”  individual financial decision-makers, however, the results suggest the value of a systematic approach to implementing practices that counteract these pervasive biases.

The results suggest first that underrepresentation of people of color in the realm of investing is not only a talent pipeline problem, and second, that funds led by people of color might paradoxically face the most barriers to advancement after they have established themselves as strong performers. 

Additional research is expected to examine solutions in more depth.  However, investing experts advising on the study believe that research, awareness-raising, professional training, and coaching as well as intentional changes to long-time industry practices, can improve the future make-up and impact of the investment community, changing the power dynamic to one that is more equitable and culturally significant.



How was the study structured? How much confidence do you have in the results — were some data points stronger or weaker?

Dodson: In terms of the methodology, we asked 180 asset allocators to rate venture capital funds based on a one-page summary of the fund’s performance history. The funds were fictional but the accompanying one-pagers were realistic, containing short summaries of the team’s track record and investment strategies. We manipulated the race of the managing partner (white or black) and the strength of the one-pager quality (stronger or weaker). Asset allocators saw one of four versions of these one-pagers. We conducted statistical analyses to determine how much managing partner race and one-pager quality affected asset allocators’ ratings of the teams. 

Dr. Lyons-Padilla: Identifying the root of racial disparities in investing is challenging because there are so few people of color in this space to begin with. Are investors biased against racially diverse teams, or is there just not enough diversity in the pipeline? We decided our first step should be to design a controlled experiment that could tell us whether, all qualifications equal, racially diverse teams face more scrutiny than their racially homogeneous counterparts.

The research team explored three distinct theories that could explain disparities in investing: 1) there is no investor bias against funds owned by people of color, suggesting that the issue is primarily a talent pipeline problem; 2) bias exists predominantly at weaker levels of performance – below the bar; and 3) bias exists predominantly at stronger levels of performance—above the bar.  

The study examined differences in judgment among asset allocators when all details about a fund’s track record and qualifications were kept constant except race.  Through an online experiment with actual asset allocators, the research team sought to determine whether there are biases in their evaluations of funds owned by black men in particular, and, if so, how these biases manifest.  

As the report highlights, “asset allocators” operate via pension funds, endowments, foundations, and sovereign funds, performing two key functions for society and their sponsors: providing high rates of return for the organizations they represent and acting as the base of the global capitalist system, allocating their funds to countless investment opportunities around the world, often through for-profit financial intermediaries (venture capitalists, hedge funds, private equity funds) managed by professional fund managers who attempt to generate a high investment return. If asset allocators set incorrect or biased incentives, the entire capitalist system will reflect and reinforce these biases.

Furthermore, while there are $69.1 trillion of global financial assets under management across mutual funds, hedge funds, real estate and private equity, fewer than 1.3 percent are managed by women and people of color.  A comprehensive data set of every venture capital organization and investor since 1990 shows that the industry has remained “relatively homogeneous”  for the past 28 years, particularly white and male. Women represent only 8 percent of investors. Hispanics make-up just 2 percent of venture capitalist investors and fewer than 1 percent are black.  And there has been no systematic investigation of the factors that cause those disparities in investment decision-making until now.  

Henning: For the main study, participants were 180 asset allocators recruited from the mailing list of an investment professionals magazine (161 men, 9 women, 10 gender not reported). A priori power analysis had determined that a sample of 128 would offer sufficient statistical power. Results from this 180-person sample proved statistically significant.  Put another way, it's more than chance that the respondents rated white-led teams higher than racially diverse teams — and, given the only difference in the fact sheets of equal fund performance was the race of the managing director, we found evidence of racial bias in these investment decisions.



This was a study using fictional funds. Surely you’ve also encountered these sorts of situations as real-life scenarios. What sort of anecdotes have you heard? 

Dodson: I’ve observed investors leaving money on the table because they underestimate the value of funds managed by people of color and women. But many of these investors did not seem to harbor conscious prejudices or even notice their biased behavior. This leads me to believe that the problem can be addressed, but we must first clearly define why these issues exist. This is true for professionals in the impact investing space too, who, seeking to improve society and achieve returns can never fully reach their goals without addressing racial bias.



What are steps investors can take if they want to address their unconscious bias? How will it benefit them… and the world? 

Dodson: We’ve developed five key recommendations for investors:

Look beyond the pipeline problem. While the talent pipeline question has been rightfully examined and remains a key part of the solution, it alone will not solve the problem. A diverse population of entrepreneurs and fund managers already exists and the industry must create practices to ensure that their pipeline reflects that diversity. 
Follow through with intentions to diversify. At weaker levels of performance, black-male-led teams in the study received higher ratings than white-male-led teams, suggesting an opportunity to increase diverse teams’ access to capital. However, allocators in the study were not seriously considering investing in weaker funds. It takes more than reviewing a one-pager or taking the first meeting to diversify a portfolio; investors must set diversity benchmarks at each step of the decision-making process. 
Support strong diverse teams. The data suggest that the more qualified diverse teams are, the more bias they face. To get at the root of the challenge, decision-makers must support strong diverse teams who are still struggling to advance. 
Amplify the presence of diverse teams. The study results suggest that asset allocators have trouble gauging the difference between strong and weak teams led by people of color. This may be for a lack of experience with diverse teams, but not for the lack of diverse teams. Allocators should become knowledgeable about successful diverse teams and distribute this knowledge throughout their networks. 
Establish a transparent selection process. Asset allocators in the study assigned different ratings to teams with identical credentials. To ensure that all teams have a fair shot, investors need to define specific selection criteria, apply these criteria consistently, and make their decision-making process transparent.

Fund of Funds

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fundsoffunds.asp

 - a fund of funds is a multi manager investment. It's a pooled investment fund that buys other funds (MFs and Hedge Funds) and that's all they buy.

Benefits: Exposure to many asset classes and 'diversification'. Supposedly outsized return when considering this 'diversification', although it's often due to them being more overweight risky sectors compared to the most applicable index.

Specific Risks (in addition to general investment risks): You completely lose control over the investment because a fund of funds is a fund that buys other mutual funds and hedge funds. If those underlying funds change their allocation in a way that now leaves your fund of funds lopsided, tough luck, you'll probably not notice it until it's already been happening for months, and these investments are highly illiquid with little to no secondary market depending on the type. Some of them you have to sit in for 1-2 years. So you can't even get out if the funds make separate, independent allocation decisions without regard for your little fund of funds (hedge funds do this all the time) and the PM of the fund of funds for whatever reason doesn't make or cannot make the necessary rebalancing adjustments. More moving parts tends to mean a higher chance that something breaks, and the more people involved in making a decision, the slower that decision is made. Meanwhile, your assets are in something potentially very different than what you initially invested in.

Perhaps most glaringly, these fund of funds invest broadly in multiple MFs and Hedge Funds, but you as an investor in the FoF don't get to pick the underlying funds. When pretty much everyone at this point knows that mutuals funds often can be mediocre and costly compared to ETFs, selecting the MF intelligently becomes more important, and with hedge funds, a bad hedge fund can blow up your portfolio in a very short period of time as their business inherently relies on high amounts of leverage, concentrated positions, and a wider variety of less regulated securities and non-security investments. Picking your hedge fund sounds pretty important to me and should be something placed at a premium, not a discount. Especially when studies are showing that most active managers don't beat the market. Wouldn't you want to pick your manager/fund?

Additionally, the fee structure is sometimes complicated or outright perverse, and the cost ratios are high. They're expensive, they're risky, they're opaque and they're illiquid.

Question: why do accredited investors and institutional proprietary traders sometimes choose these instead of a few of an increasingly wide variety of ETFs if the goal is 'blind and diversified'? These funds of funds are often only available in private placements to accredited investors, but why would someone who meets that criteria even touch these things when they're not the only game in town as far as above average yield diversified portfolios go? I am wondering if the 'allure' of being 'sophisticated' enough to qualify to invest in these things blinds people's evaluations of the actual value of the opportunity.


Structured Notes

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/structurednote.asp


These are 'hybrid securities', aka. Frankenstein monsters: derivatives disguised as debt securities. Not quite ABS, but a similar idea and often part ABS. These complicated, potentially lucrative products seem to always pop up in the bonds market (where theoretically you should go to get safe, boring low yield debt securities) because bonds are less regulated than publicly traded equities. That alone makes me suspicious of any complicated bonds, but then consider that these aren't even clearly stated to be derivatives, they're some tranch abomination of part-derivative, part actual bond and good luck to you figuring out and keeping track of the percentage for your particular structured note because they're all different, and the army of managers who structure and pass on these products have every financial incentive to make them as esoteric as possible (sound familiar?).

Some of this might sound hyperbolic and like I've watched The Big Short a few times too many, but consider that, for this to absolutely blow up, all that has to happen is that the managers overlap the underlying assets into each others' structured notes whilst once again convincing the world not to take a peek and to accept at face value that they're diversified at least across a single range of assets instead of representing the same exposure to specific underling products many times over, as happened with the CDOs.

If this happens, the correlation between different structured notes is much higher than estimated, price signalling is all screwed up, and as soon as the underling asset moves, you'll see comparatively extreme movements on the value of the structured notes because of that correlation and leverage. And, just like with CDOs, these structured notes typically offer no principal protection, which imo makes them definitively not a bond despite these attempts to put lipstick on the pig.

Oh and these also have pretty much no liquidity/secondary market. If you can find ones, it's probably heavily controlled by the trading desks of investment banks who do not have a good history when it comes to customer service and fair play on these types of products when dealing with retail investors, jussayin. You're pretty much stuck holding these until maturity which means you're stuck with outsized exposure to the underlying asset class. 

And here's the best part: like CDOs, they're marketed as products that REDUCE portfolio risk. At a time when institutions REQUIRED to invest a certain amount in bonds regardless of yield will be hitting US financial markets with record amounts of capital from Europe and Asia in addition to the massive amount of US capital that is searching for yield in this loose money economy. In retail alone (ie. People buying these things) $48 billion in structured notes have been sold, and in countries like Germany and Switzerland 6% of all financial assets were in structured notes last year (!!!)
The firms that structure these products know that institutions will start buying them up just because there's no yield anywhere else (why do you think Germany and Switzerland have the highest concentration of these assets?), so they don't waste time and money marketing these to institutions. No, they're looking for retail buyers. They once again want to push structured derivatives products on retail customers who do not understand them, and the firms have every incentive to make sure that they only communicate material information about the product to the extent that the law requires and no more. For products like this, that is insufficient, and they know it, they don't care because it's too lucrative. The more people touch a product, the more lucrative it gets for the seller.

 I know I'm really laying the comparisons on pretty thick here with MBS/CDOs but the shoe fits.

Anyone who has been in sales knows that just because something sells well doesn't mean it's actually the most attractive option for a buyer. Often, the products which sell the best are those products which most reward salesmen for selling them, as time is precious and money talks. There are too many examples of this to count, but it happens in everything from vacuum sales to surgeries, so why wouldn't it be happening again in the most directly money-oriented business in the world?

> The approach of hedge funds is to target a share they believe is heading for a fall. But the only way to make a profit is by not really owning those shares in the first place, rather “borrowing” them. Typically, the hedge fund borrows them, at a small fee, from a pension fund that is holding them for the long term.

My questions are:

- What is the mechanism by which shares are 'borrowed'? How does it differ from a trade?
- Follow on from the previous, can this same mechanism be used for borrowing currencies and commodities?
- Why would the holder of the shares lend them to someone who is going to short them - why would they not short them themselves?
- Follow on from the previous, are the shares lent at face value, or does the lender build-in a profit for themselves?"

2019-09-03,risk_parity,7,Structuring an endowment portfolio for non-profit organization that appeals to all stake-holders.,"Greetings all, 

Recently accepted an appointment to an executive/finance committee on a board of directors for a regional non-profit. There is an existing endowment fund (low eight-figures) and a new executive director and incoming board president and they want to move the endowment to a new advisor and custodian. I was tasked to take a look and make some recommendations. 

The portfolio is overly complex, in my opinion, AUM fees are in excess of 1.25% in addition to front load funds and actively managed funds. There's about 12 actively managed funds in the endowment fund in addition to over 40 individual stock tickers, 5 ETFs, and a bunch of bond and CD ladders. If I didn't know any better I would guess that the fund and stock selections are window dressing. Asset allocation for the endowment are something along the lines of 50/40/10. Performance is ok, but fees and expenses of around 2.5% are really dragging down performance when you look at it from a 5-year or 10-year timeline.

I proposed moving to a lower cost firm that could offer 0.3% AUM (based on available information online) and simplifying the portfolio to a lazy portfolio. My initial recommendations included a 3-fund, 4-fund and 5-fund portfolio. I did enough backtesting with the current endowment and my 3 proposed allocations to show that we could easily match the performance before fees in addition to pocketing another 1.5 - 2% year over year from reduced expenses by using index funds and having access to institutional shares. Also the new setup would easily fulfill the mandate of generating 5% returns without having to draw down the principal using a three-year rolling average to help model cash outflows and inflows. 

When I presented my findings, I was told by several board members that my portfolio for the endowment wasn't sophisticated enough and that I must have been missing out on something crucial. 

I was asked to work with some other board members, who are accredited investors, to come up with a more sophisticated asset allocations to “maximize upward potential but maintain capital preservation” and also look at some other firms that can provide exclusive advice and guidance. We've done one working session so far but it's left me a bit concerned. Suggestions from the session included cryptocurrency, hedge funds, private equity, VIX funds, holding physical gold in the main office, and buying up vacant property around HQ. I guess the word is out on the street because we are also getting inundated with offers for lunch or dinner with various advisory firms, banks, and wealth managers. 

As a compromise, I'm hoping to construct a portfolio that's 90% lazy (using David Swensen Yale portfolio as a baseline) and maybe window dress the remaining 10% with individual holdings and exotic ETFs to placate other internal stakeholders. Also I want to figure out a way to construct an endowment, or revise the bylaws governing the endowment, that's a bit more insulated from leadership changes or advisors. There's effectively a new board of directors every four years at the organization and this would have been the 4th time in 20 years that the endowment has been reconstructed. 

I was looking to see if anyone here has had experience setting up an endowment or legacy fund for a non-profit and what strategies or tactics did they find successful to build consensus and more importantly survive the turnover within the leadership of the organization. I feel like I really underestimated the “people” aspect of endowment investing. 

P.S. the advisor emailed me and some other board members in a panic offering to take us out to lunch and reminding us he moved us to cash during the last 2 market pullbacks. He is also emailing former board members that rolled off to see what the deal was with me, and the new leadership in general."

I understand Primary Dealers are legally mandated to bid for US T-Bills and can make money by trading them with interested parties like Insto's, Funds, Hedge Funds, other CBs via the repo rate - generally attempting to profit between the bid and repo rate. 

I would be grateful if you can share your views  on some of the things below. to me this is very interesting stuff.  I don't buy the fact that Powell said this is technical stuff and we shouldn't worry. If I was the FED I would do the same - there's not way they would admit this is serious.. 


1) why are the dealers building up an inventory? They can easily make money by bidding for the T-Bills and selling them at the Repo Rates. the level of demand is huge from outside investors. They are mandated to bid for them, but I don't think they are mandated to hold them - they can do whatever they like? So does it not make sense for them to make money? So why hold them and build up their inventory? Are they being told by their own institutions to hold them 

2) The FRA-OIS spread has significantly widenend in recent weeks. There seems to be some stress in the markets. The spread could be explained by following factors:
 A) excess supply of Short Term US treasuries, b) repartation of US dollars, c) higher risk premium for monetary policy, d) CDS for banks increasing e) fed  balance sheet declining/QT.. 


I know d) and e) can be eliminated I just checked out some data and can confirm CDS has really taken off and e) fed has injected liquidty in recent weeks. f) people expecting some stress in the financial conditions??

Maybe it's b) trump aggressive stance on China may mean he declares a national emergency and forces US companies to stop doing business with China (bit far fetched) 

Could it likely be f) we expecting some serious shit to go down in coming months?

One I'm not an accredited investor so I can't use cadre and, two, i would really like to not be limited to real estate.

Someone also told me about [darrtinvest.com](https://darrtinvest.com). Their website says it allows individuals to get invested in private equity funds, venture capital funds, and hedge funds - irregardless of their net worth. Anybody have any idea how a service like this could possibly work/ how legit this service would be? They have some information on the product once you join their waitlist but would love to hear from someone who has expertise on how something like this could work.

Anyone know of any other alternative investing platforms with active management and a breadth of financial instruments?"

He has positions in Tailored Brands (TLRD), Sportsman's Warehouse Holdings (SPWH), Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), and Gamestop (GME).  The death of retail seems to have, at least to Burry, created opportunity for some potentially serious returns. GME is trading below its book value and is sitting on over its market cap in cash and cash equivalents (I'm biased because I'm also long GME and that was before I found out Burry was long GME). CLF has high returns on capital (also extremely leveraged but they're a mining company so that's sort of part and parcel with the industry) and a high earnings yield (EBIT/EV). SPWH has high returns on capital and also a high earnings yield. TLRD, the parent company of Men's Warehouse, also has high returns on capital and high earnings yield. SPWH, CLF, and TLRD are all sitting on high amounts of debt. GME can pay off all of their debt right now and be a debt free company. If he's betting on them being priced for their earnings yield potential then he's found great companies to do it but their being highly levered is unnerving in some fashion. But I have no issue with following a famous investor into a position provided **I do my own fucking reading on the company's statements instead of buying blindly because ""what does he see that I should be seeing"" is a question I need to know the answer to.**"

2019-06-02,Greyskullcountryclub,6,"GURU vs Titan, 12 month review","GURU and Titan both pick stocks based on top performing hedge funds. Which one is better? There’s only one way to find out. Last year I put $1000 into both GURU and Titan.

&#x200B;

Titan is a roboadvisor app that will allocate your contributions amongst 20 stocks for you weighted equally. The 20 stocks are picked based on analysis of holdings from actual hedge funds. Analyzing public filings including 13F’s play a major role in determining what stocks are held.  They will apply a “short” position to the market depending on the results of your risk tolerance quiz. Seems like they are using Proshares Short S&P500 (SH) for this.

&#x200B;

All their marketing compares their services to the real hedge funds. You get the top picks, regular research digests, and inverse positions during downturns. All this makes Titan’s 1% advisory fee look like a bargain compared to the 2% fee plus 20% earnings fee that a real hedge fund would charge. Charging 1% is a lot, but it could be worth it if they can match their hypothetical 10 year returns of 12-14% annualized. If you like frequent communication on how each of the 20 corporations are performing, what moves they are making, and how the trade war is impacting business, then Titan is perfect for you.

&#x200B;

Titan periodically swaps one stock for another, but keeps a cap on 20 stocks total. Here’s what my portfolio holds:

Disney (DIS), InterActive (IAC), Charter Communications (CHTR), Visa (V), Autodesk (ADSK), Mastercard (MA), Alphabet (GOOG), Credit Acceptance (CACC), PayPal (PYPL), PTC (PTC), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Transdigm (TDG), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Amazon (AMZN), Boeing (BA), Netflix (NFLX), Salesforce (CRM), Facebook (FB), Constellation (STZ).

&#x200B;

GLB X FUNDS/GURU IX (GURU) is an ETF that runs a similar style of algorithm, analyzing the public hedge fund filings. The fee is 0.75%. It holds 60 stocks weighted equally.  The fee is less compared to Titan for a similar investment approach, but you don’t get the earnings call summaries, videos from the founder, ect. You can find what stocks are in the fund here: [https://www.globalxfunds.com/funds/guru/](https://www.globalxfunds.com/funds/guru/)

&#x200B;

Here are the values for the purchase date 5-22-18, the same day one year later 5-22-19, and a half way point 11-23-18. The chart compares the value of my Titan account, GURU value, GURU share price, and share price of SPY ETF.

&#x200B;

All of those gains have evaporated as the market takes a giant deuce. Here are the values from the 5-22-18 to last Friday.  I’m at a rough break even with Titan, and GURU is down 1.7%. I expect the retraction to be temporary. BTFD

|||1.60%|

&#x200B;

With the dip in the market, I’ve decided to add an additional $4k to Titan. I’m happy with the performance so far, and the interface is pretty slick. The regular digests make for good talking points that help me look like I’m on top of current events. When I first opened an account with Titan there was a promotion for zero fee on balances up to $1k, so no fee was deducted during the past year. My fee waiver is now expired, but a 1% fee will only cost me about $50 for the year. Not the end of the world. If I convince a friend to open an account, we both get our fees discounted by 0.25%. Four referrals earn me zero fee forever. I’m not going to publicly post my code here per the rules. If you have questions keep it out of the comments and DM me.

&#x200B;

I wish Titan offered Turbotax integration. I almost threw my computer out the window adding the 1099 information manually. The forms were easy to download from Titan, but the interface in Turbotax to enter the numbers was utter garbage. I understand minimum viable product and everything, but I’m dumbfounded that a cutting edge fintech software company doesn’t have this. Apparently there was a way to do this with an Apex account that I didn’t learn about until after I filed.

&#x200B;

As far as GURU is concerned, I’m not sold. It couldn’t keep up with SPY during the past year.  I know one year isn’t really long enough for a fair comparison. Comparing SPY to GURU since it launched June 2012, GURU gained 95% and SPY gained 99.9%. I can’t find a reason to justify owning GURU over SPY. There doesn’t seem to be a major advantage to how GURU picks its portfolio of 60 stocks. If you’re looking for something you can set and forget, there’s plenty of money to be made on index funds.

2019-04-03,theREALdeal_1,7,How to destroy SPY using leverage and top global consumer brands,"While both, risk parity and individual ownership of businesses can be viable techniques to building wealth, why not use a combination of the two given the evidence?  We all realize how difficult it is to beat SPY on a consistent basis, as even the GOAT himself, Warren Buffett, has gone on record countless times to endorse ETF's such as SPY vs. individual stock picking.

Here is a simple allocation that includes 4 securities:  

**50.0% SSO**

**25.0% AGG**

**12.5% KO**

**12.5% MCD**

The math behind this allocation works out to a total of 150% leverage: 

* 125% equity exposure and 25% fixed income exposure 

[Here](https://imgur.com/a/gDNLYXP) are the results dating back to the inception of SSO:

Out of 13 years of data (including the unfinished calendar year of 2019), the allocation beat SPY in 12 of the 13.  The single year of underperformance was 2018 with a drawdown of -5.65% vs. SPY drawdown of -4.52%.  The allocation outperformed SPY during the financial crisis years, as well as during opposite heated bull market years like 2013.  An overall CAGR of 11.21% vs. 7.96% for that of SPY.  Further, a higher sharpe for the leveraged allocation, and a similar max drawdown to that of SPY.  Take a look at [the data](https://imgur.com/a/IZAfXfT) yourself.  

And [here is the chart](https://imgur.com/a/eolmPZs) as a visual representation of the outperformance.  

I chose KO and MCD as the individual securities, as these are among the [top global consumer brands](https://www.rankingthebrands.com/The-Brand-Rankings.aspx?rankingID=334&year=1217) according to Forbes dating back multiple decades.  One could likely replace these securities with PG, and/or PEP for example, but I prefer the former given the consistently high rankings as top tier global brands.  The idea is to choose consumer brands that will act as bond substitutes during equity drawdowns, thus minimizing the allocation drawdown and creating a better sharpe over long periods of time, and to choose brands whose products/services will almost certainly be directly linked to inflation.  Both KO and MCD offer these types of products and routinely act as some of the best securities to own during large equity drawdowns, for reasons that are probably more obvious than not.

Risk parity and owning strong consumer brands (tilted towards consumer staples) are both great forms of building wealth, but why not combine the two?  While several money managers and hedge fund gurus will spend countless hours trying to beat SPY with limited annual success, a simple and proven method using leverage, strong brands and an annual rebalancing mechanism will likely destroy the pros with minimal effort.  

*as a side-note, the daily re-setting of SSO is actually a tailwind vs. what most assume to be a headwind for the leveraged product.  That is, during both 2008 and 2013, SSO actually outperformed what should have been a -74% drawdown and +64% gain given SPY's total annual return each year.  SSO certainly suffered a large drawdown in 2008, but it was less than 2x SPY, and it outperformed on the upside, greater than 2x SPY in 2013.* "
2019-07-28,closingbell,2,"WSJ: With Stocks at Fresh Highs, Investors’ Portfolios Look Alike. Mastercard, Microsoft, Amazon and PayPal are among market’s most crowded trades","A rally in stocks has triggered unusual circumstances for some of Wall Street’s biggest investors—they are holding many of the same companies.

A list of the market’s most crowded trades includes Mastercard Inc., MA 0.97% Microsoft Corp. MSFT 0.82% , Amazon.com Inc., AMZN -1.56% Abbott Laboratories ABT -0.28% and PayPal Holdings Inc., PYPL 0.32% according to analysts at Bernstein, who tracked institutional ownership, price momentum, earnings forecasts and valuations.

The overlap in the top 50 stocks holdings between mutual funds and hedge funds—two types of investors whose styles typically differ—now stands at near-record levels, a study by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found.

Investors are drawn to stocks that have performed well and risen fast. Shares that notched the fastest gains last year are valued nearly 25% higher than normally relative to their next 12 months of earnings, Bank of America’s study showed. Big movers include Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc., CMG 0.30% Starbucks Corp. and VeriSign Inc. VRSN 0.34%

Some consequences of the trend were on display last week, after earnings surprises from Amazon, Ford Motor Co. F 0.10% , Tesla Inc. and Google’s parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG 10.45% sparked outsize moves in their share prices. Tesla and Ford, two stocks that have trended higher in recent months, declined sharply when those companies reported disappointing results. Meanwhile, Google’s stock soared after the company reported that revenues rose 19% over the same period last year.

Big surges, like Google’s 9.6% gain on Friday, can make those companies even more appealing to trend-following investors, further concentrating them in a relatively small group of stocks, analysts said.

At the same time, few are willing to risk going against the crowd. Stocks that are comparatively cheap have attracted little interest, according to BofAML’s research. Short interest on what is known as FAANG stocks— Facebook Inc., Apple Inc., AAPL 0.35% Amazon, Netflix Inc. and Alphabet—is at historic lows, the bank said.

“This huge world of investible assets has shrunk down to a small cohort,” said Savita Subramanian, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “We’re all in this echo chamber where everyone goes to the same dinners and drinks the same Kool-Aid.”

This week investors are awaiting a spate of key economic reports, including data on consumer spending, manufacturing and Friday’s nonfarm-payroll report, which investors will be gleaning for information on how the U.S. economy fared in July.

While most believe the Federal Reserve will deliver a 25 basis-point rate cut at its meeting on Wednesday, strong economic data could challenge projections for how much the central bank will ease monetary policy during the rest of the year, a potential obstacle for the market’s rally.

As earnings season rolls on, investors will also get a look at results from a range of companies, including Apple and Mastercard. These two companies are among those that have provided money managers safety in numbers.

Years of tepid expansion have also made investors hesitant to broaden their holdings outside of the companies delivering eye-catching results. That caution has been exacerbated in recent months, as slowing growth around the world sparked fears of a looming recession, widening the valuation gap between growth and value stocks to record levels, data from DWS Group showed.

Yet some investors worry that the concentration of money in a short list of stocks could exacerbate market declines if bad news sparks a rush to the exits. Some of the same large tech stocks led a May selloff that pulled the Nasdaq Composite into correction territory with a more than 10% decline from its highs, a steeper drop than the ones that hit the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500.

Contrarian and value-oriented strategies have waned in popularity in recent years as investors struggle to outperform market-tracking funds. Disagreement among analysts about a company’s earning prospects can also make shares comparatively unpopular.

Kent Engelke, managing director at Capitol Securities Management, has avoided those big tech stocks over the last three years, concentrating instead on finding stocks that are undervalued relative to the rest of the market. Lately, that has led him to invest in unglamorous areas like consumer nondurables and the oil sector.

“I’m miserable,” he said. “The last three years have been among the most difficult ever out of 33 in the industry because we haven’t owned FAANG.”

He plans on sticking to his guns, however, convinced that the rally can fall apart if the Fed eases monetary policy less than expected or if companies’ balance sheets worsen.

That could result in “a really big, ugly selloff,” he said.

So far, few investors seem inclined to change their approach, although many are now increasing their positions in assets that would take the edge off a potential hit to their portfolios. Prices for gold, a popular destination for nervous investors, are near their highest level in six years, while the Swiss franc stands at a two-year high against the euro.

Analysts at UBS Global Wealth Management said that markets may be overestimating how far the Fed will cut rates and that trade tensions between the U.S. and China could weigh on growth. They have balanced their position in U.S. stocks, which is overweight relative to their benchmark, with positions in havens like long-maturity Treasurys and the Japanese yen.

“We don’t think the alarms should be ignored,” Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said in a note to clients. “But we also think the long-term opportunity cost of aborting is likely to be too high.”

2019-07-14,howtoreadspaghetti,0,Fred's ($FRED) may be a brave play if you have a stomach to lose a lot or win a lot. Honestly I'm conflicted on this. What say you?,"Right now I'm trying to scrape the barrel for any sort of company that the market thinks will shit the bed within the next year (or in Fred's case the next few months). It is a very ugly scenario for them right now as they're knocking on death's door. Their 10-Q has them officially listed as a going concern and their 8-K has them more than likely a few days away from bankruptcy. Their loans are now in question to their debtors and their debtors can accelerate the company's indebtedness (termed **acceleration of indebtedness**) if the company can't tread water for a little while longer. They obtained a loan from their revolving credit facility for $10,290,411 million on July 1 and have amended a forbearance agreement a second time. This is getting ugly as they're trying to fight off going into bankruptcy. They've announced closings of 104 stores, leaving their pharmacy locations open. By the end of the year, assuming they don't close the rest of their retail and pharmacy locations, they will have 80 stores open. They are taking drastic measures to stay open.

&#x200B;

So let's see if there's any opportunities here to find some kinda easy value.

&#x200B;

I. Start with basics. Their assets can still cover their liabilities and at no time between 2014 and 2019 have assets been lower than liabilities. I'll take that for what it is.

&#x200B;

II. Operating loss, net sales, and net losses are all much lower than they were last year. Lower volume at their stores is what is hurting them a lot.

&#x200B;

III. They're trading at a large discount to book value per share, which I have at $2.68 on a per share basis from their most recent 10-Q. Their second quarter ends on July 30. I have their book value per share at $4.71 from their 10-K. 

&#x200B;

IV. From their annual reports, I had them at $1.27B in net sales from last year. Their SG&A expenses are 30% of their operating expenses and cut a large chunk out of their operating profit. 

&#x200B;

V. Bulk of their leases are up for renewal this year and next year. They'll be doing their best to negotiate better terms for renewals.

&#x200B;

VI. They're leaning on PJ Solomon for their turnaround plan. And I think this is a rather important thing because they have a strong M&A track record. They advised deals between Zagat and Google, Lands End and Sears, B&G Foods and Clabber Girl, Office Depot to OfficeMax, and Under Armour to Mapmyfitness. That they may be advising Fred's to sell themselves to another company, say their competitors, is reasonable. Fred's provides discount pharmaceutical services to towns in low income or fixed income areas where they may be the only or one of the only pharmacy locations in those areas. They have a unique footprint in that regard that may make it attractive to a potential buyer. They've already sold assets from their specialty pharmacy to CVS and Walgreens. I can't see themselves selling to a pharmaceutical company, but I can see them selling themselves to Dollar Tree or Dollar General if those companies wanted a pharmaceutical operation. I'm looking into this one a bit more because I think a merger sign could be a catalyst for stock price increase. Their working with an IB name that has a history of M&A is very important.

&#x200B;

VII. Their CEO Joseph Anto has IB and hedge fund experience and most of his history is within that field. Once again, I can see a merger attempt being very likely in this situation. But I do't know who would want to buy Fred's.

&#x200B;

VII. The CEO is also a main holder of shares but he isn't the largest shareholder, Renaissance Technologies is also a massive shareholder as well at 2.27% of the company's equity. I wouldn't want to follow RenTech into a position because they're a quant fund that employs leverage (which retail investors shouldn't be using but that's just me) BUT any large position owned by a hedge fund should be worth mentioning because I wanna know where the big money is looking.

&#x200B;

This is really a ""They're trading at below book value per share and I'm looking for a catalyst that will make the share price climb back up"" investment idea. Their assets can still cover their liabilities but not by much and most of their revenue is made later in the year. I'll continue to look into whether or not they have an M&A option they're looking into.

tl;dr - This is Ray Dalio's hedge fund. He is known for being a very successful macro-based investor. Essentially what they show is an equal-weighted portfolio shows very strong risk-adjusted returns over the past 120 years or so and performed nearly as well as the best performing market they study over that time in unadjusted returns. It reduced geopolitical risks (and, unsurprisingly, max drawdowns) significantly. With China rising as an international financial hub, a separate economic system, sphere of influence and thus timing and effect of market cycles, they say diversification is going to be even more valuable going forward."

Here you can see the performance of the fund: [Returns](https://zh-prod-1cc738ca-7d3b-4a72-b792-20bd8d8fa069.storage.googleapis.com/s3fs-public/styles/inline_image_desktop/public/inline-images/universa%20fund.jpg?itok=3-IHiYFx)

Basically it is recommended to keep only 3.3% of your portfolio in Universa and the rest for example in SPY, all that the fund does based on the available info is buying deep OTM puts and long Vol. to hedge against events like the one we saw unfolding in the last weeks. Sadly it looks like the fund has a $25 mio. minimum investment.

Having 96.7% of your investments in SPY and 3.3% in OTM SPY puts and long VOL options seems like an ideal portfolio for me that combines the best of both worlds. You would profit from the big diversification and relatively safety of an ETF tracking the S&P 500 as well as exponential WSB YOLO returns (at least on your 3.3%) in times of market downturns like we have currently that would protect your assets and let you sleep well no matter how bad it looks.

Never selling, plowing money into index funds (time in the market yada yada yada). I'm not going to lie, it has been good to me, my portfolio has swelled and it was very easy, with almost no mental strain required.

Over the past few weeks I've watched my portfolio drop by 30% and am realizing how unequipped I am to handle shocks like this.  I never bothered to learn basic portfolio hedging techniques (buying puts on indexes etc...) Am I really just supposed to sit on my ass and do nothing while I lose hundreds of thousands of dollars? 

I think the cult around maxims like 'time in the market' and 'you cant pick winners' is dangerous.  We're telling people to stay down and dumb and never learn anything beyond the bible of passive investing.

2020-03-18,amelieaurelie,5,(Permanent) Portfolio without bonds?,"Hello, long time lurker here. Perhaps it’s a bad time to ask. Or perhaps it’s the perfect time to ask...

I have been playing for a long time with [portfoliocharts](https://portfoliocharts.com). I wanted to design a conservative portfolio for a 20yr horizon, so permanent, all-weather portfolios looked very appealing. But they all contain a sizable percentage of bonds. Currently all A bonds in the world have their interest rate near zero or negative.

Playing around, I found: REIT and stocks have a positive correlation. Gold and commodities seem to hedge stocks but not consistently, and never protected in the same way as bonds did in the past. 

At the same time, it’s very possible that bonds will stay around 0 percent for a very long time, which has never happened in history, so simulators are not very useful.

Experienced investors, what would your all-weather portfolio look like adjusted to our current new reality and why?

2020-03-18,CannabinoidKen,10,"Recession? Let's hope so! If not, we may enter into a depression.","The risk of us entering into a global depression is becoming more real by the day.  Already some of the more straight talking politicians and people of influence are beginning to publicly acknowledge this downturn will be worse than 2008.

A global deflationary depression. Something we've not seen for 100 years (and, coincidentally, has a historically pattern of appearing about every 100 years). During this time owning the stock market in broad ways (index funds) will be one of the worst performing assets.  We might see metals dropping, providing no hedge to those who've used them for that purpose.

Those of us who own properties should already be bracing for possible mark downs in our properties values and certainly be alert to the risk that continuity of rents is not assured at  least  for the immediate future.  It's being openly and prominently called for in political meetings for there to be forbearing rather than foreclosing. On a human level I agree with this,  but from an asset allocation/investors perspective this is obviously not an ideal situation.

&#x200B;

The world economic markets have been staggered lately, but there could be far worse in store.  We may be about to take a beating. A series of right hooks, and this was only the left jab.  The solution usually used at this point is to drop the interest rates and this eases different pressures and flows money into circulation/assets.  Globally central banks have now dropped. Some already all the way at zero (US Fed, for example).  Was the market assuaged? No. Prices went up very briefly and then down  into new lows.

&#x200B;

Well currently sit on the verge of an almost certain recession. At least a couple quarters of negative growth from what we have right in front of us today, but things are getting worse by the hour - literally! In some months  time we're going to be in far worse circumstances. Chances of recession are incredibly high and when we are unable to get out of recessions by stimulating growth we fall  into depression.  A depression is what comes when you can not kick start out of a recession.

&#x200B;

The best medical  systems in the  world are in danger of becoming  overwhelmed in the not too distant future.  What we've seen in China and Italy can  easily spread throughout all countries.  It could well be worse in many other countries. Italy has one of the best  medical systems in  Europe. China's efforts of quarantine and building of new hospitals is something other places will not match.

&#x200B;

Once it becomes apparent that the medical systems are going to become overrun, far harder  restrictions will be put in place.   The only people allowed out will be those who are working to maintain an essential service. This will come down to emergency staff, grocery staff and pharmaceuticals. That's it! Everything else will be considered non-essential and not permitted.

&#x200B;

This is going to lead to many businesses having to close down, and  it will be harder for them to open back up.  Currently massive bail out plans are being announced but these are only enough to keep businesses afloat for a short period of time, if this drags on months or even a year or more (as experts now expect)  there is going to be serious hits to economy.

&#x200B;

The economy is a series of people earning and spending.  Incomes will drop off sharply as people do not get their full time earnings and of course spending will decrease since people have less income. As well as this usual problem in a recession, we also have to contend with the fact there are not a whole lot of places to spend income if things continue to get worse.

&#x200B;

To support the people in the manner they are proposing to, the governments are going to have to rack up outrageous new debt on their balance sheets.  While they are doing this,  there is also various drops in government income as taxes etc need  to be reduced (or just stop due to businesses not trading). Expansions of government debts will later bring more deflationary pressures.

&#x200B;

There is currently a desire to show a lot of willingness to fund the people through to now inevitable problems the COVID19 virus is going to bring with it , but to functionally do this without causing new problems is going to be very hard.   Zero percent interest rates are doing nothing in  the US,  and negative interest rates may come next.

&#x200B;

A matter that has me most concerned is I've now heard  multiple times from politicians talk of 'replacing income' - or universal incomes.  While I am certainly for people having money to eat and live, the idea of universal income often comes linked with the Modern Monetary Theory. This essentially predicts central banks can fund everything and there will be no  fall out from that.

&#x200B;

The main threat for this in the USA. Already the Fed has been very 'giving' with its QE flowing into the markets,  but if we see the barriers dropping and the Fed used to fund all liabilities directly this can have catastrophic effects. With the USD being the reserve currency,  this means this would quickly lead to problems for global  markets.

&#x200B;

Prepare yourselves for what may be ahead.  In  a few months time, we might look back on the 'troubles' of today as the 'easier' times."

Learn to protect yourself with hedges.  Puts and inverse traded funds.  And spend the money to buy yourself some insurance.  I would suggest that at least 10% of your portfolio should be allocated to these hedges.

If these people believe it will recover but that it will take months to years to do so, then surely ""timing"" the market it just a matter of getting in at some point over the next few weeks to months?

Examples include comparing a 50-day trailing average to a 200-day, or the “filter” method of buying/selling after a sudden X% rise/drop.



So clearly he seems to imply that if there were no transaction fees (which nowadays is actually very common), some of the discussed methods could actually work.

2020-02-09,BigCastIronSkillet,107,Modeled 65 Years of S&P 500 w dividends coupled with a variable bond component. This is what I learned...,"**THE THEORY**

According the *The Intelligent Investor* By Benjamin Graham, the Investor should have a substantial bond component to counteract the dips in the volatile stock component. He should seek to have anywhere from 25% - 75% of his money in the bond component - preferentially a 50/50 split. His method suggested that you rebalance on some long-term frequency (quarterly, annually, etc.) so as to keep the balance. In doing so the theory goes that you would have money to re-invest during the dips in the market and thus come out ahead of the person who would solely invest in stocks.

**THE DATA**

* 65 Years of S&P 500 Data.

* 65 Years of S&P 500 Avg Dividend.

* 65 Years of US Treasury Yields on Long Term Bonds.

**THE MODEL**

* The model will Dollar-Cost Average into the market with some split going into the a general bond fund.

* The amount to Dollar-Cost Average is not a fixed number. Its basically a calculated amount based on inflation and lower-middle class salary investing 15% into his 401K. (All this is to say think about $100 per month in 1954 and ~$700 per month now).

* The split between the stock and bond components is initially user determined. Excel will go on to solve for the best overall return.

* Dividends, whether from the stock market or the bond component, are paid out annually and are re-invested.

* The Bond Coupon Rate is user determined -- Unfortunately the math was too complicated for a spreadsheet without running simulations iteratively to use actual treasury data.

* Re-balancing is done in either one or two methods**(More methods to come!!)**

(1) Re-balancing on a predetermined frequency.

(2) Re-balancing reactively to market conditions. Specifically, in this model it would be to dips in the market. So only rebalance when the market tumbles.

**THE RESULTS - Prefatory Comments**

As we all know the general market goes up readily year over year. Over this 65 year period to present, it has gone up 7.6% year over year. The bond component is steady given its user inputted, but in general it has decreased. The real money in these situations has been selling bonds and not waiting for them to mature. There is no easy way to track the market price for individual bonds across the years, so I will have to have an update at a later time providing additional info.

**THE RESULTS - Actually this time...**

So plain and simple, it proved to be a fruitless endeavor to have a bond component whatsoever. No matter which method of rebalancing chosen, it was better to have 100% of your money in the general market. (In-fact the reactive method of rebalancing your portfolio worked out worse than doing it on a schedule) The returns realized were far more than the market average given the dividend re-investment **OVERALL RETURN ~44,000% :: COMPOUNDED RATE ~6% Year over Year** (Some of you may be confused a little as to how you can have the market go up 7.6% year over Year on average and still do better than the market at a 6% Year over Year return with dividends, and thats because the trailing end of the model is not reflective of the averages and will both skew and distort the information. Additionally, the money recently invested will show a 0% return in the immediate; money really needs to be in the market for a while for it to be entirely reflective.)

One might be asking at this time, ok well these numbers entirely depend on the coupon rate selected for bonds, and I would totally agree. Thats why I over-estimated the bond coupon rate at 7% or more, and still it was optimal to put 100% into stocks.

For more information. Excel would change both the balance as well as the frequency in the first model and it always landed on 100% stock component as being the most optimal. In the second model it would optimize the balance as well as how much the market had to drop before rebalancing. Similarly, 100% was the most optimal. What was determined from graphing the data was that unless one had foresight into coming crashes it was only optimal to keep all of your money in the market. A future analysis will have to be done to determine about how much foresight would be needed. To elaborate further, if you could sense a market recession coming on it would be beneficial to skew your balance (something Graham recommends if possible) and this model didnt show that. This is obvious but difficult to put into practice for fear of losing out. 

Graham advised this for a few reasons that were not elaborated, in his day the index funds available to us today were not available and his advice wasnt as simple as... rain or shine you are to rebalance... as mentioned in the last paragraph, you were to use an understanding of the market to determine what ratio of stocks to bonds you should have and not keep it a set ratio. 

**FINAL COMMENTS**
If you are to invest in bonds, do so not as a consistent strategy or reactively. It should be done as a hedge against future crashes if you are to make money from it. Another analysis will soon look at foresight hedging your portfolio and then returning post-crash to a predominate stock based portfolio. Also, a 100% index fund into the S&P 500 proves to work out just fine and shouldnt be looked down upon as a great way to make money for your retirement."
2019-12-01,Kareem-Mahpants,43,Are bonds still a safe hedge?,"I have been doing a ton of reading trying to better understand many aspects of investing, even though I still have the bulk of my savings (taxable and exempt) in just a few ETF's and funds through Vanguard.  

As I work on allocations I am curious if bonds still play the role of the ""hedge"" as they used to.  If I understand things correctly, bond values rise as the yield drops.  With such low yields now, is there anyplace for yields to go that would cause a significant uptick in bond prices?  It seems like what helped bonds in the 2008 market was the lowering of yields, which pushed the bond prices higher.

Is it better to split the bond portion of my investment into half bond/half VDC (Consumer Staples), which also seems to handle price drops better than the overall market?  Or even a few dividend champion individual stocks like XOM and MO, etc...?

2020-02-21,ixikei,15,Safe haven investments to protect against simultaneous inflation and economic downturn?,"I realize that my concern isn't going to be popular, but please hear me out. I'd love to hear any criticisms of my theory but also recommendations of how to invest based on it.

I'd like to hedge against the possibility of simultaneous inflation in CPI and drop in equities over the next year or so. Long story short, but I'm concerned that the coronavirus may lead to a reduction in supply of basic goods and therefore an increase in CPI as consumers cash in on their stock gains and have lots of liquid cash to pay whatever price is demanded for consumer items. (Prices are already up on basic items on amazon as primary vendors sell out and secondary vendors sell for a significant markup. I'm glad I got cat food last week, for example.) Company revenues would also be down in this scenario (due to decreased supply) and bankruptcies ultimately up (especially if virus spreads in the US and... just think of the consequences of medical bills for starters), so I can't imagine that an index fund would be the best place to hide. QE can only do but so much lifting for equities... I follow available disease modeling and CDC/WHO projections closely, and there is a very real and rapidly increasing possibility of a global pandemic. Time will tell if it's only a nasty flu season or if the situation in Wuhan repeats itself around the world. I'd like to hedge against the latter situation.

What specific safe haven assets would you recommend for hedging against this possibility? I'm incredibly fortunate to have bought some GLD calls last week. Should I double down there? I'm aiming toward holding and executing the GLD calls on 3/31. Should I diversify into other gold or silver investments? I'm skeptical about gold mining stocks, as sick workers may still stay home and as mining firms may still be negatively impacted. Is that skepticism foolish? 

Should I also invest in inflation protected treasuries to hedge against this scenario?

What about real estate? Would now be a good time to buy a rental property if I stick to my theory? My partner and I are currently considering putting in a contract on a good cash flow house (good cash flow based on historic rental data at least...).

The possibility of drastic money printing / stimulus / QE also occurs to me. Would issuance of enormous government debt not bring down the value of treasuries? I don't feel good about buying regular bonds right now, even though they're currently going up.

What would you all do to hedge against this scary situation? Please feel free to call me a fool or an irrational fearmonger, but please explain why you believe that I'm mistaken, if you'd like to call me a fool or a fearmonger.

Jan 8th, 2020

**2019** was a pivotal year in the  psychedelic industry with US decriminalization actions, two companies  receiving FDA breakthrough status for psilocybin, funding of the **$16M** Johns Hopkins Psychedelic Research Center, The US Defence Department starting their rumored **$20M+**  Focused Pharma psychedelic science program and the movement of top  universities into research and clinical trials. With the explosion of  the more than **$100M** dollars worth of investable psychedelic opportunities in **Q3 2019**, the collapse of high quality cannabis investments, one of the best Decembers on record and a potential **$1B** scale psychedelic IPO - **2020** will be the year of psychedelic investment.

The movement in the field recently is just a blip compared to what  is to come, this industry has been brewing for the last few decades. Big  Pharma has failed when it comes to new approaches to brain and central  nervous system treatment. Due to poor understanding of mechanisms,  complex clinical trials and systematic side effects, Neuro drugs have  half the success rate of all Pharma projects, which caused most of the  big players to reduce or cut their Neuro programs in the last decades.  Recently, engagement is exploding with new clinical legislature  supporting Neuro and the recent approval of 3 potentially blockbuster  Neuro drugs in the last 2 years,

**Q2 2019** saw a record of over **$320M**  in investment into Neuro drug development. Interestingly enough an  influential group of ultra-high net worth individuals including PayPal founder Peter Thiel funded the psychedelic holding company Atai Lifesciences which went on to fund Compass Pathways and continues to fund commercial efforts in this field. Atai Lifesciences  recent movements are a familiar story of acquisition and consolidation  in an emerging market which will be a common theme in the future of the  psychedelic industry. In **2019** Atai Lifesciences acquired Perception Neuroscience and GABA Therapeutics for their next generation tranquillisers. Last week, Atai also acquired NeuroNasal, a non-psychedelic company creating a concussion nasal spray. In partnership with pharma, Atai's recent launch of EntheogeniX,  an AI based psychedelic drug discovery platform, shows that Atai is  serious about making investments into the fundamental research required  to continue being an industry leader in the long-term. It is rumoured  that Atai has made a number of cash investments recently, so new  partnerships and acquisitions should be expected in the next months.

The collapse of investable cannabis opportunities are driving  investors comfortable in stigmatised industries and binary risk to the  table with big pharma, cutting edge science and huge unmet market needs  to create a perfect storm of opportunity.

Historically, the psychedelics industry has been fragmented with around **$60M** worth of companies in the last 20 years, many of which were not sustainable. The current industry is around **$220M+** worth of investments, dominated by the Peter Thiel backed Atia Lifesciences at **$100M+** and Compass Pathways at **$50M+**, followed by Mind Medicine at **$10M+**, Fieldtrip Ventures at **$10M+** and then a 10-25 early companies in the range of **$2.5-10M** each. The **$220M+ worth of investable deals** have only existed since the public formation of Compass Pathways in **2016**, with the majority leaving stealth mode in **2019**.

Emerging Players - There are a number of emerging players, around **$35M+** in emerging deals in **Q3 2019** which have not passed due diligence.

**Clinical:**

Recent data is showing psychedelics can be real mega blockbuster Neuro drugs. Johns Hopkins recent trial on Psilocybin for smoking cessation showed an **80%**  success rate in terminating nicotine addiction, more than double any  known therapeutic approach, including nicotine replacement therapy. This  is showing addiction can be treated with new mechanisms that are much  more low level than replacing the drug in the receptor. Academic data  unequivocally shows that Ibogaine is **95%**  successful in terminating acute opioid withdrawal symptoms permanently  from a single dosage. Limited data from long-term Ibogaine for opioid  addiction trials show **50%** success rates in terminating addiction in the 6 month period with a single dosage, more than **10X** higher than the generous **5%**  success rate of other approaches in the 6 month period. Data from  leading Ibogaine providers like Universal Ibogaine show that this **50%** figure can be pushed closer to **75%** with proper protocols and aftercare. Clinical trials on Psilocybin for cocaine/crack addiction are ongoing at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a top 20 medical research university. 10 patients were un-blinded for bioethics review and the unpublished data shows that **30%** never touched crack again while the other **70%** had a relapse or two and turned their lives around, showing a **100%**  success rate in changing lives with minimal cost. When this data is  available publicly in the next years, tidal waves of interest will move  into the field.

**Projections:**

As a recreational market, **0.1%** of the population was surveyed as using psychedelics in the last month, placing the current black market at **$19.1B** while as a comparable percentage of the legal cannabis market adjusted for prevalence would place it at **$8B**.

As a medical market, the **$373B**  neurogenics market seems to be the addressable market. Penetration into  any indication in the neurogenics market would reap vast rewards.  Psilocybin is on track to compete in the depression market with two FDA  breakthrough designations, a **2%** penetration into the depression market would being **$1.4B+** in value yearly. Ibogaine's very reasonable projected **5%** penetration into the opioid dependence market in the next 10 years will bring **$9.6B+**  in value yearly to groups like Universal Ibogaine which are deploying  clinical infrastructure, supporting clinical trials and controlling the  Ibogaine supply chain. Of all of the indications in current psychedelic  clinical trials, not considering crossover, they address a **$400B+** market, with projected penetrations across each indication and adjustments for market factors, it is projected **$16B+** of value yearly will be created from commercialisation of the current late stage clinical trials which are in progress.

**Challenges:**

**Regulatory Challenges:**

While nearly 100 cities are creating legislation to decriminalize  psychedelics and multiple US jurisdictions have passed  decriminalization, federal changes will be required to open legal  markets to the full potential. While investing in the binary risk of  regulatory changes is standard in the junior markets, current regulatory  controls are preventing early revenues. Many Canadian companies  building production and distribution infrastructure offshore in  jurisdictions such as Jamaica are operating in a legal grey area. While  it is legal in Jamaica, any benefit or advantage given to a Canadian  company could be considered a proceed of crime including IP development,  capital repatriation and validation of technology offshore. Section 56  exemptions from Health Canada are required for Canadian companies  working with psychedelics offshore and companies which are raising  investment dollars without a secured Section 56 exemption may be  incurring legal risk.

**Cardiac Liability:**

The unspoken elephant in the room of psychedelic derived  pharmaceutical acceptance is not regulation, for example Ketamine is a  scheduled drug which was recently approved for the general market. The  problem is actually the liability of bringing a seratonergic based drug  to the market like Psilocybin, DMT and LSD. The crippling withdrawal of  blockbuster drug Fen-Phen and issues with other drugs like Imitrex due  to seratonin agonist effects on the heart have scared the FDA into a  position that any seratonergic drug will require extreme cooperation and  diligence and will absolutely incur additional clinical and monitoring  costs over other drugs. Psilocybin while technically hitting the 5ht2b  receptor which causes cardiac side effects, does not have a high enough  affinity to be a deal-breaker, meanwhile LSD having a very high affinity  will cause large barriers for groups attempting to bring microdosed LSD  to the market. Ibogaine suffers from cardiac liability due to an  entirely different mechanism and unlike Psilocybin or LSD, adverse  events have been reported. While Methadone and other standards of care  also have the same long-QT cardiac liability at much higher rates and  significantly higher mortality rates , Ibogaine clinical models must  pre-screen patients for existing heart defects before procedures to  guarantee no adverse side effects.

**Banking/Insurance/Exchange Issues:**

Legitimate psychedelic derived drug development companies have  already had bank accounts halted at multiple banks for involvement in  this industry and moving forward similar challenges faced by the  cannabis industry should be expected. Exchanges and public offerings  will have logistic challenges with this industry and minor friction has  already been seen in the listing process. DNO insurance and other  underwriting will be required to list in large markets and to date no  psychedelic company has been underwritten, although underwriters and  leading insurance brokers are actively exploring his industry.

**Reimbursement:**

The real whale will be insurance and single payer reimbursement of  psychedelic derived pharmaceuticals on the market, allowing for global  market uptake. Health systems have traditionally been decades behind the  state of the art as seen in the point of care and home diagnostic  device market, a market which could keep people healthy at minimal cost  but has been crippled by lack of reimbursement.

**Supply Chain Commoditization:**

The production and control of psychedelic supply chains which is  the familiar play of the cannabis industry will be a race to the bottom  with magic mushrooms and other psychedelics. Production models are  competing with a much more fluid black market and are being cannibalized  by low cost home production and wildcrafting of psilocybin mushrooms.  The LSD or ergoloid supply chain is highly monopolized, with the  majority of the worlds ergoloids being produced in a single location.  Companies competing in the production and supply chain space will face  heavy price pressure and a highly coupled global regulatory system. The  single outlier is Ibogaine, with a current global use estimated around **90kg**, expected to reach **280kg**  in the next few years, this is a commodity whose price will drive  through the roof. Large ibogaine producers have stopped production and  natural sources are not commercially viable, with an Iboga plant  producing maybe a single dose on the 10 year period, the move of  Ibogaine to endangered status in **2019**  and no synthetic GMP producers - the Ibogaine market is legal in the  majority of the world and exploding while highly underserved and  fragmented.

**Delivery System Challenges:**

A number of recent psychedelic deals are built around new drug  delivery systems for psychedelics entering the recreational market to  build expertise and infrastructure ready to move into the pharmaceutical  market. Many of these technological approaches will not translate from  the recreational market to the pharmaceutical market such as  CBD/psychedelic compositions, natural product compositions as well as  vaporizer and inhaler based delivery systems. While **20%+**  of all new FDA drug entities are derived from natural products, natural  product mixtures containing many products and a controlled substance  have never and will never be FDA approved due to the regulatory system.  Companies developing Psilocybin/CBD combinations and related  therapeutics for the recreational market should understand that unlike  the cannabis market, recreational approaches will not translate directly  to medical approaches.

**Opportunities:**

**Syndicated Investments:**

One of the largest opportunities in any emerging market is syndicated investment, a **2002**  analysis of 584 venture backed exits showed that syndicated investments  produced double the rate of return of non-syndicated investments.  Psychedelic research and development companies require standardized  infrastructure that can be leveraged across a number of players. The big  players entering the industry are more interested in empire building,  requiring massive consolidations of commercial efforts which can be  facilitated by syndicated investment groups. Companies like ThinkMyco, Entheogen Biosciences and Cybin Corporation  which focus on technology development, IP Portfolios and early stage  drug discovery will benefit the most from syndicated investment and  collaboration. A Harvard Business School  review of Pharma discovery programs statistically compared drug  discovery programs to weapons research programs and found in these high  reward/low incremental cost programs the optimal path is to run parallel  programs, with an average Pharma drug discovery program having 16  parallel programs, 10 core and 6 low budget/high risk. At the current  moment, around 5-10 psychedelic investment funds are forming in the  range of **$10-50M** each, including the Cannacord Genuity backed Entheos and the **$20M** psychedelic quant fund Tabula Rasa Ventures.

**IP Portfolio Development:**

IP development is the highest value for dollar on the investment  value chain and the psychedelic industry will be a totally IP driven  industry. The most valuable patent portfolios will include new  psychedelic compositions and therapeutic mechanisms, which require  significant investments into fundamental R+D, while less competitive  portfolios will include delivery system/psychedelic combinations.A  recent review of patents related to psychedelics shows many hundreds of  patents for psychedelic derived therapeutics with only a small  cross-section being commercially competitive. DemeRX, the **$40M+** Ibogaine research company holds 65+ patents in the ibogaine therapeutic area. While DemeRX  filed for bankruptcy and their research and development assets were  liquidated, it is rumored they have been injected with enough capital to  come back to the party - this is a dark horse to keep an eye out for.

**Mushroom/Protein Connection:**

The real opportunity in magic mushroom production models is flying  under the radar: protein production. Mushrooms are one of the highest  quality sources of nutrition and protein, if you took a vitamin C  supplement you can live exclusively off mushrooms. Dried mushrooms have  basically the same protein percentage as beef and in terms of grams of  protein per acre per year are **100**  fold higher producers and much more sustainable than traditional  agricultural practices. Companies in this space which invest into real  R+D for lower cost mushroom production will get a lift from the **$1.8+** trillion dollar protein market. A recent review of mid-sized mushroom farms shows that **50%+**  of the cost of mushroom production is due to labor and technical  inefficiencies. If energy, labor and materials cost drivers can be  reduced, and the cost of growing a pound of mushrooms can drop from  around **$2** to around **$0.75**  through automation, mushroom protein becomes significantly more  commercially competitive than many of the industry leaders in plant  based protein like pea protein. If energy cost reductions can drop the  cost even further, mushrooms will become a disruptive food source.  Psychedelic companies building mushroom production infrastructure will  be well served to remember that by investing in automation, new  technology and new growing systems the price of mushroom based protein  production can make it more competitive than any other food source. The  largest food security report in history was released **Q2 2019** and showed that without subsidies a hamburger would cost more than **30$** and the meat industry will economically collapse by **2040**, the protein game is looking more and more attractive as a hedge against the regulatory risk of magic mushroom production.

**China:**

China is one of the most advanced markets in terms of size and  pharma spending, as well as venture investment. Traditionally the Asian  cultures had no interest in marginalized and politically tense areas  such as drug medicalization but the movement into CBD and China's rabid  interest in plant medicines may create a large influx of Asian capital  moving into psychedelics. This industry shifting action will be  leveraged by education and the court of public opinion. A dialog must be  created showing psilocybin as a plant medicine and not a drug of abuse.  Interestingly enough, Chinese firms have very recently started  producing magic mushrooms industrially and importing them into the  Canadian market where they are sold into the black market  over-the-counter in some Canadian herbalist stores.

**Ibogaine:**

Ibogaine is the only psychedelic model which will not be very  quickly commoditized. Ibogaine as a solution to the opioid problem is a  disruptive technology, with the rise of fentanyl and fentanyl analogs  like carfentanil dominating global supply chains, Buprenorphine, the  preferred standard of care is no longer effective and produces a life  threatening condition called Precipitated Withdrawal. This is due to the  aggressive affinity of fentanyl to receptors, the lack of tolerance  ceiling and the little understood metabolism of next-generation fentanyl  analogues, dramatically compounding a problem already at pandemic  levels. Ibogaine supply chains have collapsed at the same time that  demand is growing exponentially, the firm which dominates the current  global ibogaine supply chain will reap around **$1.4M/mo** profit serving the current global demand. One of the largest African Ibogaine brokers has seen a **30x** increase in sales from **2017** to **2019**.  With Universal Ibogaine taking Ibogaine through the Canadian clinical  process and the grassroots support from Health Canada, Ibogaine will be  the first psychedelic approach available to consumers. While Ibogaine is  a scheduled drug in the US and some European jurisdictions, it is not  scheduled in Canada and the majority of the global market. Multiple  Ibogaine documentaries are in filming, including actors such as Johnny Depp, as this is an education driven industry, we should expect exponential growth to accelerate in **2020**.

**Support Industries:**

Industries supporting the growth of psychedelics will be a large  part of the future landscape as was seen in the cannabis sector. A  psychedelic business support network including education, conferences,  business analysis and financing have already cropped up commercially. In  **Q3 2019** the renowned Cambridge House International Extraordinary Future  conference created a panel for psychedelic opportunities. Two weeks  before the conference there was a frantic rush and the majority of  relevant psychedelic players were represented last minute in the panel  discussion including: Compass Pathways, FieldTrip Ventures, Mind Medicine, Johns Hopkins, Dennis McKenna and ThinkMyco.  Multiple psychedelic investment funds are forming alongside of industry  press, consulting groups and other support interests. In **Q3 2019**, Dr. Matthew Thompson of Johns Hopkins and Dr. Charles Nichols of LSU/Eleusis Benefit Corporation helped organize the inaugural conference for the new journal called International Society for Research on Psychedelics  in its home of New Orleans. Over 100 international scientists from top  universities were represented, with the conference having to turn down  many late registrations. Dr. Rolland Griffiths, head of the Johns Hopkins Psychedelic Research Center said ""This was the best scientific conference I have been to in my entire career."".

**Sub-perceptual dosing:**

Microdosing was popularized by Silicon Valley, catalyzing the  resurgence of the psychedelic industry but microdosing is a protocol  built on unsound fundamentals. Research shows that the therapeutic  effects of psychedelics are highly dose dependant, higher doses lead to  better therapeutic effects. The microdosing supply chain model has  excellent returns, with a pound of mushrooms costing less than **5$/lb** to produce which provides around **1200X**  microdoses. When dosages increase past the perceptual threshold, the  potential for adverse events such as bad trips exponentially increases.  The ideal dosage seems to be just under perceptual threshold where you  can still go about your day, but much higher than a microdose. This is  industry standard with seratonergic pharmaceuticals, an example being  the diet drug Belvique, which is closely related to psilocybin, dosed at  the perceptual threshold for maximum effectiveness. Belvique can cause  psilocybin like hallucinations if 4 tablets are taken as it is a  seratonergic drug. High doses of psilocybin require a clinical  infrastructure and in-patient experience, dramatically increasing costs  and logistics overheads. Sub-perceptual dosed pharmaceuticals will be  available for out-patient and take home treatment and in many cases may  be as effective as full blown psychedelic experiences. Mind Medicine, ThinkMyco and Eleusis Benefit Corporation are leading the charge in sub-perceptual therapeutics.

**Next Generation Drug Development:**

Mind Medicine is taking  the approach of engineering the hallucinations out of the therapeutic  experience by removing parts of the molecule and are moving their drug,  18-MC through the clinical process. This is the ultimate high risk/high  reward play in the psychedelic industry. 18-MC is modified which also  changes a variety of important receptor binding effects. The modified  receptors include the receptors responsible for neural growth factor  release, cognitive effects, cardiac effects and the opioid system  coupled NMDA receptor system. Since there is no data on the human use of  18-MC in opioid addicts, significant capital must be deployed before it  is even known if 18-MC is as efficient as the parent molecule Ibogaine  for treating opioid addiction, the ability to treat addiction in an  out-patient setting with no cardiac toxicity - 18-MC will be the  megablockbuster all investors in the neurogenic space are waiting for. ThinkMyco, Gilgamesh Pharmaceuticals, Mind Medicine and Eleusis Benefit Corporation are leading the field in next generation drug development.

**Lateral Drug Development:**

While psychedelics address a $373B neurogenics market, companies such as Eleusis Benefit Corporation  are showing they can address other unmet clinical needs such as chronic  inflammatory disease. Eleusis is developing new psychedelic compounds  for the treatment of inflammation, specifically within ophthalmology,  and has recently published Phase I trial results revealing the safety  and tolerability of low dose LSD in healthy older adults, with the  intention of evaluating low dose LSD as a disease modifying therapy in  Alzheimer's disease. Eleusis Benefit Corporation looks poised to cannibalize the **$3B**  steroid therapeutic market. Not yet published research is showing  Ibogaines potential as a therapeutic to treat sleep disorders. Johns Hopkins is currently reviewing the application of psychedelics in pulling patients from comas and vegetative states. The original pre-Mind Medicine  clinical trials on the Ibogaine derivative 18-MC showed promise in  treating Leishmania infection. BOL148, an inactive form of LSD,  originally the placebo in human clinical LSD research, was found to in  some cases to permanently terminate cluster headaches after a few doses  and is being publicly demanded from the cluster headache community.  These are the earliest days of understanding the application of  psychedelic derived chemistry as new therapeutic approaches.

**Public Health Engagement:**

Looking at recently released data representing North American,  working class adults, methamphetamine and fentanyl use is growing  enormously and consistently. Linear regression of growth rates over the  last 5 years projects a **380%+** increase in Fentanyl usage the next 15 years, with Methamphetamine projected at a **475%+** increase. This is concerning as there are more than a million high quality data points over 5 years and an R2 value of **90%+**  which paints of picture of statistical certainty. This shows that the  opioid crisis has moved from a lift caused by supply side drivers to an  organically growing demand side driven pandemic, fueled secondarily by  histories cheapest and most available synthetic drugs. With Johnson and Johnson settling with two counties in Ohio, projections have placed the total at **$100B+**  in fines for the opioid crisis in the next few years. State  jurisdictions will shortly receive an enormous amount of cash that will  be legally obligated to flow into anti-addiction spending. Due to poor  outcomes and non-scalable approaches around advanced public health  programs, there will be a flurry of legislature to address how to spend  the **$100B+** anti-addiction warchest. Players like Universal Ibogaine  who have proven clinical models, can deploy infrastructure and  guarantee statistically better outcomes will receive unprecedented  amounts of non-dilutive government funding and will be the first to  benefit from Decriminalization/Medicalization in the North American  market. Players that can come to the table now at the state level and  propose medicalization legislature as well as profitable clinical  infrastructure with proven outcomes, could monopolize the entire US  market. FieldTrip Ventures is developing Psilocybin clinical infrastructure while Universal Ibogaine is deploying proven clinical infrastructure already developed and proven by Clear Sky Recovery, the leading Ibogaine clinical experts with thousands of successful detox procedures and no critical adverse events.

**Closing:**

Like any emerging industry, there are challenges and growing pains  but the blue-sky upside is unparalleled. ""Black swan events are  characterised by their extreme rarity, their severe impact, and the  practice of explaining widespread failure to predict them as simple  folly in hindsight."" Due to changes in public opinion, a mental health  and addiction pandemic as well as enormous movements of liquid cash,  this sector is poised to explode in **2020**."

2020-02-06,devdevdev51,58,A detailed discussion of using futures contracts to obtain leverage; holding a long position of the S+P 500 index,"In [another post](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/eys2db/there_has_been_a_ton_of_discussion_about_leverage/), I reviewed some of the ways to obtain leverage in your portfolio. Here, I discuss futures specifically.

[Futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp) may be the most cost-effective way of obtaining leverage, or are at least comparable to options. With index futures, you enter into a contract to buy or sell the index at a future date (NOT optional), and the notional value contract can be 5x, 50x, or 250x the underlying index (in the commonly traded CME group contracts). Depending on how much capital you commit to the margin (a sort of good faith deposit), leverage can be anywhere from almost 0x up to 25x if your margin requirement was 4%. This position can be rolled forward quarterly, and leverage will increase if the index loses value and decrease if the index gains value.

You do not earn dividends, although this is reflected in the futures price (Future Price = Spot Price \* e\^((Financing Cost – Continuous Dividend Rate)\*Time to Maturity). When interest rates are high, the exponent is positive and the futures contract trades at a premium; you can end up paying a significant amount of roll adjustment in a market in contango. When interest rates are lower than the dividend rate, the exponent is negative and you get a discount for buying a futures contract; a market in backwardation is helpful for those looking to hold a contract long-term. Note that this roll adjustment does not occur when rolling a contract forward, but rather gradually over the life of the contract.

While all that might sound complex, the effect of contango/backwardation has not been substantial over the past 20 years as a whole because interest rates have been both higher and lower than the dividend rate. Let’s say we decide to trade the [E-mini S+P 500 contract](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/emini.asp), where the contract size is 50x the index. If you were to enter into a futures contract in 2000 when the index value was \~$1400 and roll it quarterly, you would be forced into a margin call and essentially wiped out in 2008 with any amount of leverage >1.5x (starting balance of ≤\~$47000). If you “rescued” your account and injected enough cash to avoid margin calls, you would have had to put up \~$4500 at the worst of the recession, and turned your $47,000 into \~148,000 in December 2019. This sounds great, but if you had simply invested your initial capital plus the $4500 in an S+P 500 index fund and reinvested dividends, you would have \~$164,000 with much less risk. “Rescuing” your account when starting with higher leverage has similar results, with higher ending balances, higher “rescue” requirements, and similar returns to the S+P 500 with dividends reinvested. By the way, releveraging or hedging your account by going long or short on Micro contracts (contract value 1/10 the Emini), you would do even worse.

Of course, if you started with $47,000 in 2010 and rolled forward 2 E-mini futures contracts (2 because this results in starting leverage of 2.36x compared with 1.2x for 1 contract) until 2020, you would have ended with \~$269,000 compared with the S+P’s return of \~$165,000. So, if you could somehow time the market, leverage obviously does well.

The only way I found of consistently beating the passive index holder since 2000 was to “double down”, or invest more money AND increase your leverage by buying additional contracts every time the index drops significantly. Let’s say you decided to start at 3x leverage with \~$24,000 committed, then trade an additional contract (increasing your leverage, requiring extra money to be injected into your account to avoid margin calls) every time the index dropped to 2/3 of its starting value ($952 for our example of starting in 2000 with the index at $1429), and wait at least a year to “double down” again. You would have started trading 2 E-mini contracts after the dot-com bubble burst in 2002, 3 during the 2008 Great Recession, and maintained those 3 contracts until December 2019. You would have injected \~$36,000 (more than the value of the initial account!) and ended with a final value of \~$427,000, compared to just investing your original $24,000 + $36,000 in the S+P 500 (reinvesting dividends) and ending with \~$191,000. Of course, this requires serious resolve and access to extra cash when the economy is at its worst. My next plan is to test this strategy over many time periods.

The final consideration is taxes. If you invest in a taxable account, you will be on the hook for only the long-term capital gains tax of 15% with stocks and ETFs, and you can realize those gains at the end of your investing period. LEAPs and futures are subject to the 60/40 rule, where 60% of your gains are taxed at the long-term rate of 15% and the other 40% is taxed as short-term gains (taxed as income), and you have to do this every year (although you can tax-loss harvest).

**TL;DR Leverage results in greater gains and greater loss, but can be expensive to obtain. Options and futures are the most cost-effective way of obtaining leverage. Holding a leveraged long position with options and futures is possible, but can be completely wiped out with severe drawdowns. An aggressive futures trading strategy of increasing your leverage and cash committed every time the index loses significant value could be profitable if the value of the index increases over time.**

Does anyone here use futures to obtain leverage?

**Edit:** Some of you are misunderstanding how leverage changes over time. Here is the link to some of the data ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hF1IXWXWZLZraVevnkL0oWVKuQMCQs6dXO46o8E7Zmw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hF1IXWXWZLZraVevnkL0oWVKuQMCQs6dXO46o8E7Zmw/edit?usp=sharing)).

2020-03-26,sellside_sandy,7,Market Outlook - March 2020,"Hi guys, just want to share with you my current market outlook. Hope this can help spur a discussion for everybody's benefit. This is not a an investment advice. You are not my client and I am not your fiduciary. That said, the views below are just for discussion purposes.

At the risk of being cliche and obviously wrong, here I go:

**Short term-medium term:**

1. We are in a bear market, and recession is already underway.
2. Occasionally, there will be ""bear market rallies)"". For long term investors, these are not a time to buy **yet**, use it to sell instead. For traders, bear market rallies and the volatility that they bring, are great opportunities to make money. Dow Theory suggest there could be at least three bear market rallies within the overall bear market trend.
3. Reason why I think the downturn will continue for short-medium term: The USA is still early in the coronavirus infection blow out. Look at updated chart by JP Morgan and FT [here](https://ibb.co/tsSwJcg) and [here](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest). The Fed is doing everything they can to keep liquidity/market functioning. The fiscal stimulus that the government is trying to pass, should dampen the blow to the economy. But, as long as the coronavirus situation i.e, the public healthcare crisis, the real crisis, is not tackled immediately through decisive action like other countries, then it will only prolong the infection period. See Bill Gate and WHO's opinions [here](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/bill-gates-us-missed-its-chance-to-avoid-coronavirus-shutdown.html) and [here](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-who-sees-potential-of-us-becoming-new-coronavirus-epicenter/). IMO, the market is still underestimating the coronavirus infection and the blow to the economy that it could bring given ineffective measures by the government.
4. The market could at least fall for another 15% before it starts to find a bottom based on previous bear markets.

**Longer term:**

1. Stocks would eventually go into bull market again.
2. Among the indicators that signal bottoming/reversal would be volatility (VIX) returning to normal level.
3. High quality companies, I would imagine mega-tech with pristine balance sheet, would rally first and perhaps perform the best in the upcoming bull market.

**Asset Allocation**

***Short term***: Short equity via inverse ETF, short emerging market stock/currency - especially countries with twin deficits (fiscal and trade), long gold, long treasury. Or just stay in cash.

***Risks:*** As what happened previously, gold and treasury did not provide the hedging characteristics. They went down together with stocks, while in normal condition, it they should go up. One possible explanation is that funds are liquidating any positions that they could, to satisfy redemption and margin call.

***Things to avoid: 1)*** **Options**, because options are currently trading at premium in general due to high implied volatility. Also remember that with options, you have to nail three variables to make money - direction, magnitude, and time horizon. Also, avoid **2) triple leveraged ETF/ETN.** The volatility and leveraged used in the ETFs will cause a ""decay"" in your return if the market trade sideways. As for ETN, their prices could fall to certain level that trigger ""acceleration event"" in which case, the investment banks issuing the ETNs will redeem the ETNs from you, usually at a steeply discounted price.

***Long term:*** Long equity, with overweight on mid-mega cap tech stocks."

2020-03-07,ovideos,1,When (if ever) to sell on a falling market?,"I know, and pretty much 100% believe, the advice that:

1) people who hold statistically do better than people who try to ""time the market"".

2) selling after a big loss is a mistake unless you are in need of cash.

The exceptions to this is, of course, some company that is clearly in a death spiral.  But as long as you're invested in mutual funds/ETFs, it would seem that holding on is better advice.

But I wonder, at some point you may believe the market as a whole is a losing proposition.  Are there any classical signals that people (like hedge/mutual fund managers for instance) would take to mean ""sell even if you're losing because you're only going to lose more""?

I understand that the big error in this thought is the fact that no one ever really knows when bear markets will bounce or dive, but I'm curious to know if anyone disagrees with that common wisdom?

To clarify: I'm not talking about people who pull out at the top and then only have to decide when to buy back in.  I'm talking about people who decide to ""cut their losses"" and when they do it, and how often does it turn out better for them?  That kind of thing."
2020-02-17,roman-roman,1,Dai Savings Rate is at 7.50% APR.,"The Decentralised Finance space is developing and offers some interesting financial instruments. One that particularly caught my attention is Dai Savings Rate (DSR). Dai is a decentralized stablecoin (i.e. 1DAI = $1) built on Ethereum platform (MakerDAO project) with over 100M market cap.

One feature of DAI is the possibility to generate variable yearly interest with no exposure to any (volatile) crypto asset. Current rate at 7.50 APR  makes it a very lucrative investment. Rate can change, but it's not necessary to lock funds for prolonged time - if it gets too low one can simply exchange dai back to fiat currency to invest elsewhere. Many exchanges provide liquid DAI/USD pairs.

While holding DAI doesn't expose investors to the volatility of ""normal"" crypto assets, there are other risks to keep in mind:

* Wallet Management: utilising DSR requires careful management of keys and performing transactions. While it's only a couple of transactions, losing a private key or sending funds to a wrong address can lead to loss of all assets. One should start with smaller amounts first to get comfortable with the system.
* Smart Contract Risk: the system is decentralised, and a bug in the contract can lead to fund loss. However, the MakerDAO smart contracts were audited multiple times and already hold significant amount of funds for prolonged time, making this risk much lower. 
* There might be a bug in Ethereum itself - very unlikely at this point. If desired, it can be hedged with buying Put options on ETH.

2019-07-12,rajatajmera10,772,Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips For Beginners,"Warren Buffett is CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, but he bought his first stock when he was just 11.  According to Forbes, Warren Buffett is worth $82.5 billion, making him the third wealthiest individual alive behind his friend and co-founder of Microsoft, Bill Gates, and Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.

“When a individual with cash meets an experienced individual, that individual with experience ends up with cash and that individual with cash leaves with experience.“.This was Warren Buffett’s response, when asked about his best investment advice. Warren Buffett says that experience is the ultimate key to be a successful investor.

One of Buffett’s most famous quotes is “Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.”

Warren Buffett is considered to be one of the best long-term investor, so it’s no wonder many people like to listen closely to Buffett’s words of wisdom, in order to apply them to their own lives. With that in mind, here are Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips

Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips

Investing is long term Game

Money doesn’t grow overnight, by getting nine women pregnant you can’t make a child in a month. No matter how good the talent or attempts are, Warren Buffett is just saying some things take time.

Investment planning should be done by considering long term goal. Investor goes for futures and options with the hope of making quick money but they are actually the one who loses more money.

Warren Buffett never did trading (Intraday or Positional). Warren Buffett also says “If you aren’t willing to own a stock for 10 years, don’t even think about owning it for ten minutes.”

Diversification isn’t always a good idea

Many good investors says diversification is good idea for investment in stock market. But Warren Buffett tends to disagree with the idea.

Warren Buffett suggests diversification is for individuals who have little knowledge of investment. An experienced investor should select long-term stocks and have confidence in their investments.

“Diversification is a protection against ignorance. It makes very little sense for those who know what they’re doing.” – Warren Buffett

Some investors diversify their portfolios because they are afraid that any one stock might sink their entire portfolio; but, while doing so, it becomes much harder to keep focus on individual investments. They may decrease their portfolio’s volatility by diversifying, but at the same moment decrease their focus on individual investments.

Excessive diversification also means that a portfolio is likely invested in a number of businesses, diluting the impact from its high quality holdings.

“The idea of excessive diversification is madness.” – Charlie Munger

Don’t invest in a company whose business you don’t understand

This is one of the most important Warren Buffett’s Investment Tips. People invest their hard earn money just by hearing something good about the particular company from others. You can determine if there will be any related economic issues in the future by knowing the company. In the stock market, there are many firms whose company can be understood by any ordinary individual. Buffett warns you should never invest in companies you don’t comprehend completely.

Trust yourself to be a successful investor

Warren Buffett says that the hardest thing is to trust your investment decisions. You always think that others are right and you are wrong. Instead, you need to study and believe in yourself.

“I always knew I was going to be reach. I don’t think I doubted for a minute”- Warren Buffett

To be successful, you need to overcome the fear and not pay attention to what others are telling you. Accumulate understanding and create investment choices to stand apart from the crown and be a winner on your own.

Think like an owner

Warren Buffett always says in his interview, you have to thinking like an owner changes your whole views on stock investing.  Warren Buffett says if you are going to own a new car/bike, you will think about its fair valuation, you will think about its features and you will compare it with cars/bike offered by other manufacturers from the same segment. Then you’ll decide which one to purchase after reviewing everything. Similarly, stocks should have the same view.

Prefer quality stocks than cheap stocks

A lot of people buy stocks just because they are cheap without understanding that cheap is not always better. Charlie Munger’s Buffett discovered that “buying a great company at a fair price is far better than buying a fair company at a great cost.” Chances of losing money in cheap stocks are very high compared to investment in a fairly valued stock

There’s no room to be emotional

“Some individuals are not supposed to own stocks at all because they are too annoyed by price changes. If you’re going to do stupid things because your inventory is going down, you shouldn’t own a stock at all, “Warren Buffett said during a cnbc interview. Some people aren’t really mentally or psychologically fit for their own stock, but I believe more of them would be,” Buffett said if they were more informed about what they’re actually purchasing, which is component of a company"
2019-09-23,space_spider,19,Hedging against home price devaluation?,"I'm a noob investor, but I'm about to make a large investment into a single asset (my house), and I'm feeling a little bearish on future home values. Hedging against a downturn would help me sleep a bit better at night. So my plan was to short some REITs. But after pondering it a bit, I'm not sure this will do what I want it to do. What I want is insurance that I can exercise if the value of my house goes down. In the case of stocks, this would be a stock that tracks the value of my house (and only my house) which obviously doesn't exist. In the case of REITs, the managers of the trust will rebalance the portfolio to (attempt to) optimally increase shareholder value. So if I'm shorting REITs, it's not clear to me how much I'm shorting the managers' abilities and how much I'm shorting ""the market"" (in quotes because the definition changes between REITs). Is this the right approach to hedge against home value depreciation? What else can I look at?"

Then their followers choose whether or not they're going to take the risk, and more often than not, the guy was right. 

I'd just like to get your take on these people. Here's a random example from google:

2020-02-26,canuckinfla,3,Tips for a novice's portfolios,"Hello, I am currently managing two portfolios (one in CAD, one in USD). Quite new to investing. Currently my gf and me we have maxed retirement accounts, and maxed employer pension contribution. My current portfolios look like:

Cash: \~150k

Holdings (CAD): 

* 30% in ZQQ/XQQ (ETF tracking Nasdaq 100 CAD-Hedged)
* 20% in RBC's Global Technology Fund
* 20% in RBC's Global Technology and Life Sciences Fund
* 10% in VFV
* 5% in VUS
* 5% in ZPL (BMO Canadian long term provincial bonds ETF)
* 5% in XRE
* 5% in XUT 

Very messy, North America oriented, tech-heavy portfolio. Lost several thousands in (unrealized) gains in the last few days. I am fine with that. All I did is to laugh about it and go r/wallstreetbets for more stories, lol. However, I am in process to rebalance to something simpler e.g. couch potato.

Holdings (USD): 

* 50% in VTI
* 40% in VXUS
* 10% in BND

Still under construction, but aiming for 3-fund, maybe with some REITs. Is 90/10 stock/bond too aggressive?

My questions:

* As I am quite new to investing, would some slice&dice or tilt be workable, or strongly not recommended? E.g. 5-10% of total portfolio toward mutual funds / ETFs tracking Nasdaq 100, S&P500, or REIT ETFs. The reason is that I think tech, especially with the recent AI boom, has pretty good growth potential than some other sectors. While real estate seems to have quite consistent performance edge over some other sectors.
* Equity vs real estate: would a bit of real estate fit in a portfolio, or are REITs preferable? I am quite  uncomfortable trading on margin, but ok to leverage by taking a fixed rate mortgage.

Planning to set <5% of portfolio to active investing in the future, mainly for fun. Would love to build a mostly passive portfolio, eventually with enough income for retirement. Any suggestion is greatly appreciated. 

Thanks!

Something I am willing to learn, and practice with (fake) money first:

* option trading (especially when used to hedge against risk)

Something beyond my current risk tolerance level (but feel free to correct me, especially if these items are less risky than I though):

* trading on margin
* derivatives more exotic than options
* day/swing trading (I do not consider myself competent enough to consistently time the market)
* leveraged ETF, as leverage magnify losses more than gains
* naked shorts, option writing, etc. anything that has potential for large losses
* YOLOing ...  

&#x200B;

More details:

* Age: 33-34, 
* Salary income: 200-250k/year. Very safe and stable, even in the event of a 2008-level crisis.
* Tax status: US resident for tax purposes (gf), Canadian resident for tax purposes (me)
* Risk tolerance: low (gf), medium (me)
* Time Horizon: 30-40 years.
* Assets: negligible. House worthy \~500k, but mortgage payments ongoing 
* Mortgage: \~10% of our after tax salary
* Other expenses: \~20-30% of our after tax salary 
* Savings each month: 60-70% of our after tax salary
* Other Debts: No student debt, no other debts.
* Other financial information: No need for kids education fund, as our employer will cover it. House is large enough to raise kids, so no near term big house purchase unless we want it."
2020-01-03,LBJDL,6,ETF shares in another currency. I’m in the UK but I want to invest in the US (hence in USD!!),"I’m planning to start my investments but unfortunately here in the UK we don’t have (yet?) commission free trading.

I’m considering opening a tax free account (ISA) with Vanguard UK, and then have an account with Degiro to have my stock picking activities (as Vanguard only offers funds).

It’s not possible to hold USD in my vanguard account, and when I click on the S&P500 ETF (VUSA), the share price is in GBP. How is this possible? I guess this is not the same ETF as the VOO (which was the one I wanted to invest in the first place).

Also, I have another question on Degiro: they only accept GBP transfers, but I wanted to place there USD (using Revolut to do the exchange, as they offer really good prices with no commissions). If any of you have an account with Degiro, can you share whether the translation costs are significant?

Thank you and have an amazing 2020!!

EDIT: ok guys here is the table I created:

|GBP VUSA Return|11.05%|
|:-|:-|
|USD VOO Return|11.46%|
|GBP Currency Return|6.59%|

The way I computed these was as follows:

**Collect the data**: I collected the historical prices using the following sources:

* For VUSA: directly from the [Vanguard UK website](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/investments/vanguard-s-and-p-500-ucits-etf-usd-distributing/price-performance?intcmpgn=equityusa_sp500ucitsetf_fund_link). If you scroll down, you can see the price on the chart. I selected a historical of 3 months because I selected data since October 3rd 2019. I had to write down one by one because they don't provide the option to export the data to excel.
* For VOO: from [Yahoo finance](https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOO/history?p=VOO), from October 3rd 2019 to December 31st 2019.
* For USD/GBP: you can take from several providers but I took it from [here](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=USD&To=GBP).

**Compute returns**: I built a column on excel with the historical prices of each ETF, and then computed simple daily returns in the form of Pt / Pt-1 - 1 in a second column. Then, I created a third column to compute the cumulative value of a £500 investment. For the VOO, I translated the £500 into USD using the prevailing USD/GBP rate as of October 3rd 2019. That rate is 0.81285, meaning £500 were equivalent to 500 / 0.81285 = 615.12 USD. This was the value I used as a starting point for VOO;

**See the final investment value as of Dec 31st 2019**: which gives me:

* For VUSA: £555.24
* For VOO: $685.62

**Translate the VOO investment back to GBP**: at a prevailing rate of USD/GBP of 0.76263 (as of Dec 31st), we get 685.62 x 0.76263 = £522.87.

I don't understand the discripancy of the values. The GBP appreciated 6.59% between Oct and Dec, but the returns do not match even with a hedged exposure. Both ETFs track the S&P500 and the differences are very significant for a very small £500 investment."
2019-12-11,bumjae1,46,Goldman Sachs is Bullish on Gold in 2020,"After a strong first nine months of 2019, gold peaked at a nearly 25% gain at the onset of September. Goldman Sachs remains bullish on the yellow metal.  


Since then, as the S&P 500 increased more than 10 percentage points, the gold price [declined](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/09/goldman-sachs-pushes-gold-on-popularity-of-modern-monetary-theory.html) 7 percentage points over the same period, for an increase of 17% on the year. Despite the pullback, Goldman is still bullish.  


“Gold’s strategic case is still strong,” Goldman Sachs ’ Mikhail Sprogis, precious metals analyst at Goldman, wrote in a note to clients. “We expect ‘Fear’-driven investment demand for gold to be supported by late cycle concerns, political uncertainty and high \[developing market\] household savings.”  


He highlighted how interest rates remain historically low, suggesting this is a bullish sign for gold, since there is a limited chance of bond prices rising, which could send investors to safehaven investments like gold.   


Like Deutsche Bank, he believes “more widespread discussions of \[Modern Monetary Theory\] could lead to greater demand for gold on debasement concerns.”  


Another reason for increased gold demand is increasing popularity of Modern Monetary Theory, MMT, which suggests national debt is not a constraint on countries. Bernie Sanders-advisor and economist Stephanie Kelton subscribes to this theory, as does Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY).

Fiscal concerns around national debt are unfounded, proponents suggest, as long as inflation remains low. They suggest low rates should be taken advantage of in order to fund infrastructure and social programs to boost growth and reduce inequality.  


“In the next recession, our US economists do not expect governments to adopt direct monetary financing and expect inflation to remain firmly anchored,” Sprogis wrote. “But this doesn’t necessarily prevent an increase in debasement concerns if conversations around MMT become more widespread — a potential boost to demand for gold as a debasement hedge.”  


Goldman’s 12-month target for gold of $1,600 per ounce calls for an 8.5% gain from Monday’s opening price. In the past 12 months, gold has increased nearly 14%. Continuing political uncertainty could increase demand for gold.  


“High political uncertainty due to continued trade tensions and the approaching US elections should also be supportive gold in 2020,” Sprogis wrote. “This uncertainty may be one of the reasons why we see evidence of a non-ETF vaulted gold build, as high net worth individuals may want to store gold outside the financial system.”

I'm a UK investor and I have a portfolio of various funds including index and managed funds. This is with Hargreaves Lansdown, and they are all GBP funds. For example:

Yesterday (Friday 11th) the news was all joyous about stock markets rallying over positive trade talk news, the S&P, Dow, FTSE were all posted gains around 1%. Why is it that my portfolio yesterday is showing a loss of 1.5%? The human irrational part of me finds this very unfair, storming all the bad news weather and as soon as it turns positive my portfolio doesn't seem to reap any of those rewards.

I imagine it's to do with either valuation point, so the gains will be reflected on Monday?

Or it's because the funds are in GBP and GBP strengthened against the USD on Friday, where most of the stocks in those three funds are US stocks so the currency movement is actually adverse?

Still seems odd, clicking into the top 10 shares in each of the funds, those shares are all posting very healthy gains for the day but the fund as a whole is down 2%. Specifically the fundsmith one which only has 27 shares, and the top 10 shares which constitute almost 50% of the fund are all way up, I can't believe that the bottom 50% of the fund are all down to counter the top 10's gains.

If this is an adverse currency movement, what can I do as a UK investor to protect against this?

However, I *can* buy Fidelity FSAGX, which, from their website:   ""Normally investing at least 80% of assets in securities of companies principally engaged in gold-related activities, and in gold bullion or coins.""

I can see that FSAGX has tracked the price of gold since its inception in 1985.  But inflation has been relatively low for a majority of that time.

I'm curious how well a mutual fund of gold company stock could be expected to track the price of gold during times of higher-than-usual inflation like the 70's.   If the price tracking breaks down during high inflation, then FSAGX isn't a very useful inflation-hedging instrument.

2019-10-16,CautiousInvestor,8,New research claiming the reasons to invest in bonds have mostly disappeared.,"Marketwatch is reporting on [new research from Bank of America](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/bank-of-america-declares-the-end-of-the-60-40-standard-portfolio-2019-10-15) claiming the traditional reasons for investing in bonds are for the most part no longer valid.

From what I gather from the article, the researchers - Derek Harris and Jared Woodard - argue that the two main traditional reasons for investing in bonds are:

1. Hedging against equities dips.
2. Collecting fixed income.

The researchers claim that bonds no longer serve the _first_ purpose well, as their volatility has increased. Also, the negative correlation to stock valuations, that has made bonds a good instrument to hedge equity exposure, is a historical anomaly that is likely to reverse soon: of the past 85 years, this correlation has been negative for only the last 20 years, before which it was positive.

The researchers further claim that bonds no longer serve the _second_ purpose, either, because of large drops in bond yields:

> Indeed, the $339 billion in inflows to bond funds globally in 2019, and the $208 billion in outflows from global equity funds underscore the power of the ongoing rally in bonds, which has caused bond yields to fall enough that there are now 1,100 global stocks that are providing dividend yields above the average yield of global government bonds.

The elimination of both these reasons leaves us with no motive to invest in bonds at all. Indeed the researchers encourage investors to invest in equities instead, particularly equities offering high-dividend yield, which would thus serve the same income needs you would traditionally expect from bonds.

What do you think of these claims?"
2019-08-25,Matt1251255,16,Would Berkshire hathaway be a good hedge against a downturn?,"Hi,

I am a beginner and just learning fundamentals of investing. However, I had a question , do you think BRK.B would be a great hedge against a downturn? My reasoning is because Berkshire's cash position (100B+ from my understanding) would allow opportunities to deploy this capital in a downturn. The stock is great as a long term investment from my understanding, one of their largest downsides is having their large cash position as a drag on yield.

I have not read this idea anywhere after searching, so I would like to get the opinion of you guys. I know Buffet/Munger have a history of investing in sort of low risk / companies with great balance sheets and with predictable returns (no ""fancy"" stocks). My reasoning is that in a downturn they would be able to deploy capital and pick of value companies for pennies on the dollar, similar to what they did in '08. What are your thoughts?

Thanks

Edit: (I almost entirely do indexes for investing purposes, I am just curious on your thoughts on Berkshire - even though it is sort of like a mutual fund from a diversity perspective). I am also not necessarily asking because I think a recession is imminent, just curious. Thanks."
2019-12-04,hugewildcat,0,Cash Instead of Bonds for an Equity Glidepath,"I was reading [this article](https://earlyretirementnow.com/2019/07/31/rising-equity-glidepath-4-percent-safe-withdrawal-rate-60-year-retirement/comment-page-1/) on the EarlyRetirementNow blog noticed an interesting comment by the author: ""With a cash-\[glidepath\] you would be better hedged against such a scenario, so no complaints from my side if folks prefer cash over bonds"".

This struck me as something to bring up because it feels like the vast majority of people on the various finance subs are vehemently against holding cash for anything more than an emergency fund. Bonds *always* win.

The scenario referred to was the 1970s supply shock with an inflation shock, and the original comments that prompted the response included ideas like preferring ""cash instead of bonds for purposes of the glidepath"" and the plan being ""a cash/equity split at the start \[of retirement\]"", ""something like 90/10, but with the cash portion increasing through retirement date, and ending up more like 70/30"". The implication was that the 30% cash would then be re-allocated down to around 10% as a glidepath.

Another interesting comment by the author stated: ""Not sure if that bit of upside is worth the downside risk of a repeat of  the 1970s. So, I can see the appeal of the cash instead of bonds."" More food for thought. 

Anyone have any thoughts on replacing bonds with cash equivalents and perhaps taking on a higher percentage of equities as a result?

Any thoughts on portfolios including solely cash and equities?"

**Global Equities**

* We see a China-led stabilization of ex-US growth and the pause in US monetary policy tightening as key to prolonging the business cycle, just as they were in early 2016. In particular we view the probability of a recession in the coming year as low given the strength of labor markets and consumption across the developed world. We believe that the global economic growth is stabilizing around its trend rate.
* After inconsistent Fed rhetoric prompted fears of a US monetary policy mistake in late 2018, a clearer and unequivocally more accommodative Fed narrative has emerged. In our view, the Fed is now likely to let the US economy 'run hot' in order to rebase inflation expectations. With scant evidence of significant momentum in US core inflation, the Fed has considerable breathing room.
*  The ability of China to cushion its slowdown continues to be key to the global economy and markets. The Chinese authorities have a broad range of policy tools at their disposal and have shown willingness to use the full breadth in achieving a difficult balancing act between de-risking a highly leveraged and capital inefficient Chinese economy and softening the slowdown prompted by those deleveraging initiatives.
* In our view, risk assets discounted material concerns about factors including the potential impact of a protracted US/China trade war at the start of the year. The speed and scale of the rally in the face of disappointing macro data globally and downgrades to forward corporate earnings expectations suggest strongly that expectations for good news on US/China trade talks have now been largely priced in. We remain constructive on global equities, but the speed and scale of the rally in 2019 has tempered to a degree the conviction of that positive view. The likelihood of further material upside for risk assets in the short term is, in our view, now dependent on the ability of ex-US demand growth to accelerate from current weak levels to support earnings. In particular, the effectiveness of the broad array of measures progressed by the Chinese authorities to cushion their growth slowdown remains critical.
* We retain a negative view overall on developed world duration over the medium term. With global growth showing signs of stabilization, we think it is too soon for the market to be pricing material easing from the Fed, although the risks around this view have increased with apparent Fed determination to boost inflation and inflation expectations. Across the Atlantic, we are unconvinced that the ECB will be unable to tighten this cycle. In our view, yield curves are likely to steepen as global growth rebounds along with inflation expectations. While wage growth has yet to materially impact core inflation measures, developed world labor markets continue to tighten. We see nominal yields moving gradually higher as output gaps close, wage growth accelerates and the global economy stabilizes. However, upside to nominal yields is likely limited by structural factors including fast ageing populations in the developed world and technology-driven price pressures.

**US Equities**

* During the first few months of the year, US equities benefited from a resilient domestic economy and a lower exposure to global growth factors compared to other major indices. While we do expect US stocks to remain supported by easy to beat consensus earnings expectations and solid US consumer demand, the recent pickup in Chinese exports and manufacturing activity should support ex-US stocks to a larger degree as they exhibit higher cyclicality and trade reliance. US equities trade at a premium relative to other markets leaving less room for further rerating.

**Global (Ex-US) Equities**

*  In Europe, growth has decelerated considerably, due to external and domestic factors. Externally, China's slowdown and trade uncertainty negatively affected European exports. Domestically, political upheaval in Italy and France along with disruptive auto emissions regulations weighed on the economy. However, we expect those headwinds to fade over the coming months. European stocks remain supported by solid domestic demand dynamics, attractive valuations and by a likely stabilization of global economic 
conditions towards the second half of 2019.
* We remain constructive on Japanese equities despite the recent headwinds from weak Chinese imports. Diminished political uncertainties and ongoing structural reforms are supportive of higher price multiples while a solid underlying domestic economy suggests the outlook for profits is stronger than markets are discounting.

**Emerging Markets (EM) Equities including China**

* Emerging market equities have this year underperformed developed market equities driven by a continued deterioration in earnings but the surge in Chinese social financing bodes well for EM growth over coming months.
* We remain broadly positive on China in the expectation of further measures to cushion the domestic growth slowdown. Any broadening of the current trade stand-off with the US is likely to hamper Chinese growth, but a gradual economic slowdown is already priced in and the Chinese authorities have already shown themselves willing to provide monetary, fiscal and regulatory support to help smooth the ongoing economic transition. Chinese equities still trade at a PE discount to other markets and further market liberalization could prompt a rerating as international capital starts to flow into Chinese assets following the inclusion of onshore Chinese equities in MSCI's widely followed EM equity indices.

**Currency**

* As signs of stimulus from China begin to take hold, we expect ex-US growth to stabilize. Over time, we anticipate capital will flow from the US into earlier-cycle economies and that the USD will weaken, especially as the USD remains somewhat expensive on a real trade-weighted basis. Elsewhere, we continue to see strong valuation support for the JPY and see short AUD as an effective hedge against ongoing China weakness in an economy where domestic household leverage is likely to constrain growth.

**US Bonds**

* After the recent downward repricing of US rate expectations, 10yr nominal US Treasury yields appear reasonably value given our outlook. Nonetheless, US nominal yields look attractive relative to most other developed government bond markets on an unhedged basis. In the absence of a material pickup in inflation or term premium, yields are likely to remain range bound. Our overall assessment is neutral.

**Global (Ex-US) Bonds**

* In aggregate, we see global sovereign bonds outside of the US as unattractive. The ECB has committed to low rates for some time, limiting attractiveness of core Euro area bonds. We find Italian BTPs attractive on diminishing political risks. Swiss bonds continue to look very overvalued and in our view they have an increasingly asymmetric risk profile. The Swiss economy is relatively strong and we see Swiss bonds as vulnerable to attempts to normalize monetary policy by a Swiss National Bank increasingly concerned by the strength of the housing market.
* Elsewhere we are more positive on Australian duration on a relative basis. We see the Reserve Bank of Australia taking a cautious approach to policy given elevated household leverage and slow inflation.

**Investment Grade (IG) Corporate Debt**

* Although we do not believe that a sharp demand slowdown is imminent, we believe IG spreads troughed for the cycle in early 2018. Moreover, we are concerned about increased supply, reduced demand, and potentially large number of ""fallen angels"" when the economic growth takes slows down significantly and downgrades begin.

**US High Yield Bonds**

* Current default rates in high yield are very low by historical standards. Given the still relatively positive economic backdrop, we do not expect a material pick-up in US defaults in the near term. However, after the significant recent rally, spreads have now tightened to a point where we see the balance of risks skewed towards more widening.

**Emerging Markets Debt**

* Spreads on EM debt relative to US Treasuries widened substantially in 2018 in the face of higher geopolitical risks, a strengthening USD and higher USD funding rates. However, EM local currency bond yields have rallied both in absolute terms and relative to the US yields since September while EM hard currency bonds yields began a rally in late November. This reflects investor expectations for a less hawkish Fed, less aggressive US trade policy, and/or more China stimulus."
2020-01-06,trevorip,0,Questwealth (Growth) RRSP Portfolio - second opinion?,"Hi,

First, I'm in the ""simple/convenience"" camp when it comes to investments.  Eg., my TFSA is just self-directed VGRO on QT, but I might be looking to switch it out to a CCP model portfolio in the near future.  

My current RRSP is more than double my TFSA, and I have 20 years left to go before retirement.  That said, my focus/cash-flow is building up my TFSA in the foreseeable future, so my RRSP will be somewhat inactive.  When I decided to switch from my old TD Bank's Mutual Funds (sick of fees), I put them into QT's ""Questwealth Portfolio"" (formerly known as Portflio IQ) in a ""Growth"" AA.  

Now, as I'm learning more about the various EFTs and which funds would or would not be tax-efficient within RRSP, I'd like a second opinion?  Ie., would there be an advantage if I switch it to another self-directed one and just roll with VGRO like my TFSA (ie, reducing MER)?  Also, I've never heard of anyone talking about the ""WisdomTree Canada Dividend"" fund, which is what Questwealth uses.  

FYI, here's their list of funds:

\- ISHARES CORE CANADIAN UNIVERSE BOND INDEX ETF  (Fixed Income)  / 1.8%

\- ISHARES CORE CANADIAN SHORT TERM BOND INDEX ETF  (Fixed Income)  / 16.2%

\- WISDOMTREE CANADA QUALITY DIVIDEND GROWTH INDEX ETF (CAD Equity)  / 24.96%

\- SPDR PORTFOLIO TOTAL STOCK MARKET ETF  (US Equity)  / 22.95%

\- SPDR PORTFOLIO EMERGING MARKETS ETF  (International Equity)  / 5.04%

\- ISHARES CORE MSCI EAFE IMI INDEX ETF (CAD-HEDGED)  (International Equity)  / 23.05%

\- ISHARES GLOBAL REIT ETF  - (International REIT)  / 4%

\- Cash / 2%

&#x200B;

I understand that no one can predict the future so I'm not asking if this will give me a good return.  Instead, I'm asking from the perspective of their choice of funds (again, I've never heard of WisdomTree), if I can do better from a tax-efficiency perspective if I were to self-direct this in a RRSP, etc.

2019-08-12,u---wot---m8,45,A comprehensive analysis on Spirit Airlines ($SAVE),"In 2017, a Reuters poll showed that U.S flyers preferred cheap tickets over perks and comfort when traveling. Spirit Airlines is a small, but steadily growing ultra-low-cost airline that capitalized early on this trend by introducing ""bare fares"" and ""no frill"" flights, offering relatively cheap base rates for tickets, but charging extra for almost everything else, from choosing seats to bottles of water, essentially unbundling the services that a traditional airline would have included in the price of a normal ticket. Today, we are going to analyze the airline industry, as well as Spirit's operating efficiency, growth, risks, and valuation to ultimately decide whether or not it makes sense to be a shareholder of the underdog airline. Unless stated otherwise, all numbers and statistics presented below are as of August 7th, 2019.

###The airline industry

Until recently, airlines were notoriously unprofitable businesses. Fierce competition led to aggressive price cutting, with many airlines losing money on each flight, resulting in massive losses industry-wide. Between 1977 to 2009, the sector suffered combined losses of over $52 billion. However, recent bankruptcies and mergers consolidated the industry, leading to increases in capacity, operating efficiency and overall profitability. In fact, Warren Buffett, who had once called airlines ""a death trap for investors"", now owns a stake in all of the big four U.S airlines: American, United, Delta and Southwest. The big four currently dominate the U.S domestic airline industry, with almost 70% combined market share.

In spite of its history, 2018 marked the 10th consecutive year of profitability for U.S airline industry. Capacity has grown at an average rate of 2.5% each year since 2009, and major U.S airlines carry over 17% more passengers than they did 10 years ago. The industry is expected to continue growing, with the U.S Federal Aviation Administration forecasting a 1.9% average annual growth in passengers over the next two decades.

Operating efficiency is key in the airline business. Airlines run at relatively low margins, so modest increases in unit revenues or decreases in unit costs can tremendously affect overall profitability. For example, the expenses of scheduled flights do not vary significantly with the number of passengers carried. Whether a flight is at full capacity or half capacity, the airline will incur similar labor, fuel and other costs. Therefore, on the revenue side, a slight increase in load factor (the percentage of aircraft seats actually occupied on a flight) may significantly improve the overall profitability of a flight. Similarly, on the cost side, a slight percentage increase in fuel costs could have a materially negative effect on an airline's operating profits.

Labor and fuel costs disproportionately represent overall airline expenses. In 2018, labor and fuel represented approximately 24% and 32% of Spirit's operating expenses respectively. Therefore, an airline's operating efficiency depends highly on its ability to bargain effectively with its labor unions, as well as the pricing and availability of aircraft fuel. Some airlines manage fuel price volatility risk through derivative contracts. Others choose to pay market rates over long periods of time as a form of natural hedging, letting the occasional high price average out the occasional low price.

###Operating Efficiency

As one would expect, Spirit has relatively low unit revenues, given their cheap ticket prices. However, Spirit also has the lowest unit costs in the United States, and therefore has the advantage of being able to maintain profitability at low prices where its competitors cannot.

Spirit maintains another competitive advantage by operating a single-fleet type of Airbus A320-family aircraft that is one of the youngest and most fuel efficient in the United States operated by common flight crews. By operating a single aircraft type, Spirit is able to avoid the costs of training crews across multiple types while also making flight crews interchangeable across all aircraft. Additionally, the average age of an aircraft in Spirit's fleet is only 5.4 years, allowing for comparatively low maintenance costs. However, it is expected that these costs will increase as the fleet ages.

In terms of performance, Spirit has been steadily improving. In 2015, Spirit ranked last among all U.S airlines in on-time arrivals. However, following a management change the following year, Spirit climbed its way to first place in on-time performance in 2018, while continuing to maintain its low costs. Additionally, Spirit's cancellation rate improved from 6% in May 2017 to only 0.56% in the same month the following year.

###Growth

Although Spirit has been around since the 1960s, it only transitioned into its current business model of ultra-low-cost-carrier in 2007. As a pioneer in the ultra-low-cost-carrier space, Spirit's brand reputation has taken a beating over the years for being perceived as excessively stingy (customers were surprised about having to pay for a bottle of water), as well as their poor on-time performance and cancellation rates. However, Spirit's brand has seen steady improvement over recent years as customers became more understanding of their business model, and as late/cancellation rates declined due to operating efficiency improvements. As a result, Spirit has more than doubled its share of the U.S domestic market to 4% in the past six years. It has grown its revenues by 72% over the past five years, and plans to continue growing its capacity in the mid-teens over the next several years. Spirit's ability to grow its earnings will depend mostly on whether or not it can execute on its capacity growth plans and minimize cancellations, while continuing to manage and reduce costs. Over the next few decades, they may see gains from macroeconomic tailwinds, as the air travel market is expected to grow steadily. Additionally, low-cost-carriers have been consistently growing their share of the total air travel market, and if this trend continues, Spirit would be well-positioned to benefit.

###Risks

Spirit is susceptible to many of the same risks as other airlines, including disruptions or cancellations from unexpected weather problems and other factors beyond Spirit's control, rising oil prices and other variable costs, as well as other macroeconomic issues such as economic downturns. However, most of these issues are short-term in nature, and don't pose existential threats to the business. The greatest threat to Spirit's business is increased competition from traditional carriers. Beginning 2015, domestic carriers with far more resources than Spirit began to match lower cost airline pricing in order to compete with Spirit and other low-cost airlines. So far, Spirit has been able to hold its ground, continuing to grow its revenues and market share. However, it is uncertain whether or not Spirit can maintain its rate of growth in such a competitive environment.

Additionally, Spirit's assets are almost 70% funded by debt, due to the large upfront costs of purchasing aircrafts. This could put Spirit in a bad position in the event of an economic downturn. However, this is somewhat offset by Spirit's strong cash position of $1.22 billion compared to its current liabilities of $1.21 billion, resulting in a cash-ratio of 1.01, which is relatively high compared to other airlines. Over the past several years, Spirit has continued to maintain a strong cash position relative to short-term debt, demonstrating their intention to be prepared in the event of an economic downturn.

###Valuation

The following discounted future earnings model makes the following assumptions: Spirit's earnings will grow at 5% year over year for five years starting July 2019; it will have a price/earnings ratio of 11 at the end of this period; and the investor demands an 11% annualized return during this period. Discounting future earnings under these assumptions, Spirit's present value is approximately $3 billion. Its current market capitalization is about $2.8 billion, meaning that the stock is currently undervalued under these assumptions. However, any model is only as good as its inputs, and even a small change in expected earnings growth, terminal price/earnings ratio or discount rate could have a significant impact on the present value. Whether or not you should to invest in Spirit at these prices will depend on your own expected future value and required rate of return.

###Conclusion

Despite being an underdog in the U.S domestic airline market, Spirit is a company with relatively strong fundamentals and solid growth potential. However, Wall Street does not seem to agree with this sentiment. Spirit's price/earnings ratio of 8 and price/book value of 1.36 seems to imply very low expectations of growth, despite a history of consistent, moderate growth. If Spirit is able to effectively execute on its growth plans, it may prove to be a very profitable investment at today's prices."

We've gone public in H1 this year, and I'll be able to sell stock grants that have vested over the last few years of working here. I'm looking for help on what fraction to sell, and how to do so in tax-advantaged situations.

**Numbers:**

* Age: 29
* Location: San Francisco
* Current salary: 220K
* Current annual stock grants: \~400K at current share price
* Current vested equity: \~700K at current share price, tax already withheld at \~53% (Fed, CA, Social Security)
* Net-worth: \~230K: \[170K in 401K, 40k in ETFs, 20K emergency fund, no debt.\]

Big questions I have:

* What percentage makes sense to sell when the employee lockup expires to balance risk? I recall guidance to not let a single stock make up more than 10% of your portfolio, but selling so much makes me worry about taxes, especially because of this next point:
* I paid tax on the equity based on the IPO list price, and shared were withheld on my behalf. The current price is \~40% higher than the list price, and I believe selling this year would realize those gains as short-term, while I can realize them as long-term if I wait to sell in Q2 of 2020. Does it make sense to avoid selling for another \~6 months? I almost see the change in taxes on the appreciation as a hedge for a drop in the stock price."

I would prefer an ETF which reinvests the dividends to defer taxes (no 401k-like option available). This category of Bond ETFs exists, but they do not mature. That means, when selling my assets at some point the gain solely relies on the current Stock value of the underlying index. Depending on the current correlation between stocks and bonds at that time this can mean I lose money if both are down (positive correlation). Or in short, not an ideal hedging strategy.  


What I would prefer is a Bond ETF structure that reinvests into Bonds but still matures at a given time (buying new bonds which mature at the specified date). Thus, I would defer taxes and still get the money I put in back.

It seems to me if you invest in something you expect to go up and hedge some against your funds going up all you accomplish is dragging your returns in exchange for losing less in downturns. Your investment should go up over time so hedging a small portion just drags that number down in exchange for not seeing as much money lost in downturns. So what’s the point of investing in something that zigs when the market zags if you expect the market in the end will yield positively?

My example may not make much sense so what about having anything in bonds for the long term? The stock market will beat bonds in the long term so what benefit is there?

2019-04-01,cooleddy89,61,Investment Hypothesis: The market is fundamentally mis-pricing climate risk and reward.,"Hi All,

This is a bold statement, but I believe the market is significantly mis-pricing the risks around climate change from several angles (see below). I think it's relatively uncontroversial to suggest that capitalism in general has trouble dealing with negative externalities. My investment hypothesis is that certain industries are in effect taking on increasing, uncompensated, and unacknowledged climate risk every year (e.g. insurance, oil supermajors, coastal real estate holding companies, etc.). At the same time, other industries (e.g. clean technology, water processing / desalination, etc.) have increased upside given the nature of these risks. 
 
* Disruption to Insurance / Re-insurance organizations: Increased risk of catastrophic disasters means that either insurance companies either a) raise premiums or b) limit their coverage. Climate change causes global insurance companies significant issues because it is a correlated risk, i.e. there is an increased chance of flooding in Thailand and hurricanes in the Gulf. 
* Coastal Real Estate: I'm not suggesting that cities will be underwater in the near term, but long before that situation occurs vast stretches of high value, coastal properties will be ineligible for insurance and may suffer a massive decrease in value (how many people can / will self-insure a high risk million dollar property?).
* Government Bonds: Governments will be forced to spend heavily to either a) mitigate climate change through infrastructure projects and/or b) compensate or assume financial liabilities to avoid financial panic and protect vested interests. We are seeing early signs of this in the fight over federal flood zones in the US and reforming the federal flood insurance program. Developed governments will fund these efforts with large new bond issuances, which eventually may cause investors to demand higher yields. 
* Oil Supermajors: As climate change costs rise, governments will face political and financial pressure to recoup money from the companies ""at fault"". This may take the form of carbon taxes, direct penalties, etc. Even if governments fail to take action state / private class action law suits will proliferate as affected individuals attempt to recoup losses. An early sign of this is the lawsuits around the California wildfires and PG&E (although obviously this is a utility). 
* Tax Rates: Given high debt levels and current account deficits during an economic ""expansion"", developed countries are ill-prepared to face a general recession. The debt issue will only compound as governments also face increasing financial pressure from climate change adaption and assumed liabilities. As a consequence, governments will likely raise revenue through overt or de facto tax rate hikes. Political pressure will force governments to consider taxing corporations and ultra high net worth individuals first. 

To hedge this risk I am investing 20% of my portfolio in renewable MLPs, clean technology ETFs, and private infrastructure companies. Although historically these asset classes have lagged broader market benchmarks, I believe we will start to see political pressure to invest dramatically in these areas, e.g. the Green New Deal. More importantly I think governments will attempt to finance large scale climate adaption projects via public-private partnerships due to budget constraints. 

Note: my timeline for investments is 10-20 years. I do not foresee significant climate impacts in the next several years, although there are a number of climate non-linearities that we simply don't know / cannot model (e.g. melting permafrost releasing significant amounts of methane into the atmosphere leading to a dire feedback cycle). 

Thoughts?

Edit: Great debate so far, appreciate all the great points! A couple clarifications here:

* I totally agree that picking winners in the renewables place is very difficult. I don't do that, I use ETFs. This is a sector play and tilting my investments away from certain areas. Plus, the value chain of renewables is far more complex than simply solar panel manufacturing. Look at the financing, operationalization, efficiency, etc. advances that are occurring. Many of these companies have  highly defensible intellectual property or operational expertise.
* There seems to be a common misconception that I'm saying sea level rise will simply wipe out certain areas. That isn't my point. Long before sea level rise swamps areas the added risks of storm surge, ""king tides"", hurricanes, etc. will make areas uninsurable. Property and businesses cannot function without insurance. There's a reason why insurance is one of the largest industries on the planet. 
* Yes, this is a very long term play. And I very well could be wrong (I sincerely hope I am!). But I can't exactly buy ""puts"" on climate change. My hypothesis is that this is a serious threat to my portfolio and, obviously, humanity writ large. I suppose I could start investing in some doomsday ideas like gold, bunkers in inland, high elevation areas, etc. But I choose to be a little more hopeful / constructive. 
* I don't expect to make 10x my money here. But I do see a steadily increasing investment in this space. The political pressure is increasing in the US, China already has firm targets (and this is exactly the type of top down project that appeals to the Chinese government for stimulus), and Europe / Japan are already well on their way. At some point too the rapidly growing economies of Africa, Southeast Asia, etc. will need more energy. Economics alone already dictate that most of that new energy will come from renewables.

They are in the Navy's nuclear propulsion side of things, so they're locked in for 5-6 years until their contract expires, and I'm not sure if the Navy has ever forced nuclear personnel out for purely budgetary downsizing reasons.

Their situation:

- No debt of any kind other than credit card usage that is paid down every month
- Roth and TSP (federal version of 401k) maxed out every year since 2016 or 2017
- About $80K in taxable investment accounts
- 2 month emergency fund in high yield savings account, would bump it to 3-4 months from just the leftover money after all TSP deductions and expenses if he takes the loan just to be safe
- 5 years old car that's still doing fine
- Single and no GF

Their plan was to go for something like 50/50 mix of S&P500 and US Treasury bonds.

Both of us are aware that the market could go tits up right after the funds are invested, but he believes the Treasuries will be a suitable hedge against that risk and in the worst case, he could sell the bonds to replenish the emergency fund if it's used up for something. And since he has guaranteed employment (as long as no drug/DUI or sexual harassment incidents occur), so if everything goes into the red, he can sit tight and keep making the monthly payment."

I am doing a 50%/50% split between Vanguard Total Stock & Long Term Treasury, based on the backtesting from 1998, this combination has significantly less swing than 100% stock thanks the the way stock and treasuary hedges each other, and actually outperformed it.  I am aware backtesting means nothing for future performance, but the hedging concept makes a lot of sense to me, and long term treasury is higher return AND provides better hedge than any other bond fund I know of.  At end of the day, money is strong, power is stronger.  


The problem is, in the last year long term treasury went up 20% so my portfolio is out of balance. Meanwhile, I am trying to add more money month after month into the portfolio. I stopped adding new money to treasury as it is quite a bit higher than 50% of my portfolio now, I am putting new money in stocks instead, not sure if this is the correct approach! Would love to see some math behind this.  I am not aware of any backtesting tool that allows you to do this and it is also kind of difficult to model this in Excel."

about the difficulty about moving portfolio allocations in taxable accounts. I have plenty of stocks in my portfolio that I have held for close to or over 10 years. In my country there are also laws that if an investment has been held for more than 10 years its purchase price for tax purposes is calculated to be either original or 50% of current value (which ever is higher), which means that the on paper tax burden is reducing with time. In the current market situation I would like to reduce my portfolio risks, but selling anything will result in very large tax effects and as is demonstrated in the article, that will in the end cause tax friction that will be money lost in the long term. **What strategies are others using in these situations?** I have a very basic strategy of keeping ""new money"" on the sidelines (mostly on short term bonds, which as an investment is pretty bad besides the low risk) when I see risks increasing and investing that into stock market when situation gets worse. In the current situation I have also been thinking of adding around 2 year hedge on the portfolio through either options/warrants/bear fund. That is pretty expensive often, but adding that for even 20-30% portfolio value would mean that when I want to get fully invested again I would have a lot of dry powder and I would not create the tax friction on my current investments."

2019-04-14,patrickMsc,0,"Trading BOTS Discussion: Can returns on Crypto Arbitrage really be this good? This small fund is seeing 213% ROI and offers 3.5% fixed monthly return as a 'Loan Agreement', rather than an equity-based investment.","I was recently approached with an interesting 'investment' option to say the least. At first glance it appears 'too good to be true' but the more deeper I look into it the more legit it appears to be. Before you shout ""scam!"", I expect you to have read through the actual documentation I was sent (attached), but would like to open the discussion for if this kind of investment option might represent the potential future for this kind of investment 

They offer two 'Loan Agreement' products, of which they are contractually (contract seems robust-enough from a legal standpoint) obliged to pay you fixed (or compounding) repayments based on the amount you 'loan' (invest):

- **3.5% 'Fixed'** with a fixed Monthly Repayment (42% Annualised Return!)
* e.g Invest (""Loan"") 10k, get $350 back every month, after 12 months, you'll have 14.2k.
- **5.0% 'Monthly Compounding'** with a Yearly Repayment (79% Annualised Return!)
* e.g Invest (""Loan"") 100k, 1st month 10k turns into 10.5k, 2nd month turns into 11.025k etc... until 12 
    months later your yearly one-time payout is 17.96k.

Essentially this Fund was initially underpinned by a Bot that automatically actions 'Arbitrage Trades' across various Cryptocurrencies (e.g buying BTC in one exchange and selling BTC in the other and cashing in on the difference), but now is also investing in:

1. Rental Property Development
2. Cannabis
3. Minerals (e.g. Nickel, Copper, Cobalt)
4. Water Reclamation and Plastics Recycling

According to their history, the fund is seeing a ridiculous ROI of 213%. Their true 'selling point' is not that their offering these 213% returns on every dollar you invest like a 'traditional investment'-style fund, but actually, by keeping most of the profits to themselves per se, they are able to essentially *pay* you a fixed income each month, by creating this 'Loan Agreement' relationship with a written contract whereby they are legally obliged to make payments to you as a person (at either 3.5% or 5% rate as described above). 

I have a better idea of *why* Crypto Arbitrage isn't a big thing that everyone is investing in because of [this Whitepaper](https://arbitragect.com/arbitragect_wp_en.pdf) (page 4-6), but I'm still a bit guarded about the legitimacy of the incrediby attractive commercial return they more or less guarentee you through a 'Loan Note' (much in the same way your obligated to pay a Bank back for the money you borrow in monthly repayments - but in reverse - you get paid a fixed (or compound) amount based on what you 'loan' to the fund. 

Now this is the sticking point for me - what is the actual level of risk if a Lawyer could verify that the contract (see link to contract below) could very safely protect your investment - except in the case of Bankruptcy or similar I guess - which they protect heavily against apparently with a Guarantor backed by property assets and hedging strategies etc.. (see FAQ document attached for further 'worst case scenario' topics addressed)... If you are effectively guarenteed to be paid in a contract and have the option to take them to court to recover the money, is it only the chances of bankruptcy that have to be considered?  

They apparently had offered higher yield options in the past but simply had to reduce the returns they offered because they often scared people away for appearing 'too good to be true', so I can understand that part. 

**Has anyone else heard of this type of Investment before - essentially this 'Loan Agreement'?**

2019-04-11,FinanceAfter50,0,"Why is everyone on the news channels saying ""Healthcare"" !? but keeps going down!","More than one big brokerage house / fund company, etc. is saying they are picking ""Healthcare"" as their undervalued, ""hedge"" (usually along with tech...but that's different)  but why does it CONTINUE to sink?

&#x200B;

I don't want to get into a value trap like the banks that I was investing in for the last year, and they just keep sinking or treading water.

&#x200B;

I'm in a decent Fund that is down about 5% over the last 2 months.

How should I play this?"
2019-04-09,drdanieldoom,0,Why I don't think APRN is completely dumb.,"APRN is an odd lot. It has all the trapping of a growth stock, it’s nearing profit by the most dismissable metrics, and it has the largest brand in its niche industry. It’s value as an equity has been massacred. 

The IPO is famously disastrous. Poised similarly to any other growth focused IPO, but with an measurably more tangible product than most. Blue Apron suffered the Amazon drop which has occured for many companies since, but APRN was hit earlier and has never recovered. This is puzzling on two fronts, one all other companies suffering similar comparison have moved on when it became obvious that Amazon is not the niche killer they were assumed to be and secondly because Amazon never created a competing service as was speculated. In the wake of this APRN has seen the rise of competitors some of whom have received series funding as recently as Q1 2019. This suggest there is sentiment leaning into the viability of the potential profit cooked into the demand planning industry. 
APRN is a demand planning business, that is their primary function. Sure, this is only used in three product options, but it is the core business and the backbone of expansion in the future. Customer retention has fallen, but APRN has matched this with efficiency increases. Either the meal kit delivery business is viable or it’s not. Blue Apron has upside in both these circumstances. None of the businesses in this space are mature, but APRN is the least adolescent. If some of these businesses fail sunbox, homechef, etc. APRN is positioned most resiliently and can profit from customer moving from a direct market competitor to APRN. If the meal kit model is viable then APRN is the most mature and will see benefit in a more traditional manner. 
There is a blessing in the stock price: a moat. The price shown in Blue Apron makes all venture capital investments very IPO reliant. If any demand planning business operating in this sector is going to prove profitable by reasonable metrics it will be APRN. The claims of former CEO to reach EBITA profitability has been too quickly dismissed. It seems that the reasonable investor has forgotten that these intellectual cartwheel metrics are the first stepping stones to simple net profit. There are several improvements APRN can make. 
First, the marketing approach needs reform. They should focus on converting as many users of competitor meal kits to Blue Apron products as possible. In service of this, the free meals promotion should be removed from general access and provided only to conversion customers who are newly acquired. Secondly, loyalty programs should be improved. Providing invitation to offer others free meal kits isn’t enticing or providing nay hedge against users moving to other companies even if they continue to spend in the meal kit space. Rewards should include tangible knick knacks and branded items. The Blue Apron website is a mess. It’s beautiful, but lacks most forms of function. Several clicks are needed from opening the website to purchase and many options are hidden. 
Secondly, APRN needs to more deeply leverage their weight watcher’s partnership. They should apply a discount commiserate with the decreased shipping costs by shipping meals for members to their Weight Watcher meeting location this applies the marketing of peer pressure and can reposition the product in a space much more leveraged than the: we sell this in stores now approach of 2018. A similar partnership should be created in other similar spaces such as say...Planet Fitness. The mode of profit will only marinably found in the meal kits. They are a potential tentpole, but they cannot remain the exclusive product. APRN must begin to leverage itself as a Demand Planning enterprise rather than a meal delivery service. Provide a second subscription product selling only interesting dry goods, spices, and equipment. This can leverage their logistics structure. This is a far flung example, but imagine that Amazon had never realized they aren’t a book company. They would have been flushed away in the Dot Com Bubble. Blue Apron needs to position as Demand Planning and Subscription company. 
New leadership opens up the promise of these sort of changes, realizations, and positionings. If I had the capital to take a serious position as an activist investor and pressure these policies, I would have full confidence in APRN. If leadership shows signs of better market presence, better utilization of influencer advertising, and adjusting their understanding of their core functions, then I can see a 10.00 price with a two year target. 

This probably won't happen and they should have waited longer on an IPO, but I don't think it's the stain on the market it's treated as."
2019-05-03,notjakers,0,How do I hedge future interest rates?,"Right now, I have a 3.75% mortgage, which is great. Let’s say the balance is $100k for simplicity. I’m planning on a renovation, and would like to cash out $20k to partly fund that work. Problem is, if I did that my rates would jump due to generally higher rates, a LTV of 80% (75% is more typical in cash out scenarios). So a mortgage broker suggested the following. Get the HELOC at 5.5%, draw on that for a year, when the house is complete get a new appraisal and refi the place. 

Which works out great if rates are still under 4%. But I’m screwed if they’re now 5% or higher, aspecailly as the HELOC rate floats. So now I get to the investor question.

If I wanted to hedge my loan, or get some insurance, what are the paths for that? I’m thinking a contract that pays off if rates are above 4% on about June 1 of 2020, enough that if rates spike to 6% I may get hosed on my HELOC, but at least I’ll pocket a similar amount as the contract will pay off (and I’ll just keep my first mortgage indefinitely). 

What kind of contract would I buy?  Fairly savvy investor, but usually just playing with stocks, ETFs and mutual funds."
